"Seroquel makes depressed I have major depressive disorder and social anxiety  I take  400mg seroquel for sleep and have a weird side effect , when I take it makes me have those sudden life realisations about my self *really bad thoughts” 

Exactly like a bad weed trip and that’s why I stopped smoking weed .

It’s weird since I’ve tried all drugs from benzos and opium to ssris and snri and it’s the only drug that makes me feel this way 

Why I am feeling this way? I searched a lot and couldn’t find people with the same problem",Anxiety
"Frequent cold sores (ulcers) on lips and intense fear of Bell’s Palsy returning Hi all, frequently ill and frequently anxious person here. I’m going to be seeing my doctor (again) to ask about this issue but lately (past few months) after a really bad flu that resulted in a mouth full of ulcers and palsy afterward (which I luckily recovered from), I’ve been terrified of this happening again. I feel I have been getting more frequent tiny ulcers on my mouth almost every month or so. It scares me every time I feel a warm bump. I have no idea why they are so much more common now and it’s disheartening (and discouraging - they’re ugly!). And, it scares me that the palsy could return or flare up again as I’ve read that it’s very possible :( 

All of this stresses me out so much and I know that can’t be doing my body any favors. Just wanted some comfort as I try and deal with the fear and the actual physical symptoms.",Anxiety

"Health anxiety taking over my life Since I got the flu this year, I’ve been constantly worrying about my health. I wake up in a panic every day. I am constantly worrying that I’m losing my vision or that I have MS, brain tumor, etc. I’ve gotten blood work that all came back perfect. I’m only a teenager but these worries are controlling me all the time. I’ve been on medication for a month and a half and started seeing a therapist a couple of weeks ago but it still isn’t doing the trick. Are there any tips that you guys can give? I’m beginning to feel hopeless. ",Anxiety
"worried i have something seriously wrong to start off i’m pretty sure i’m suffering from depersonalization/derealization. after i smoked weed (even though i had smoked many times before) about a month ago i just had that unreal feeling. apparently this is very common. smoking weed, having a panic attack, and then BAM depersonalized. 
i have anxiety and depression, so even though what this is is most likely just depersonalization i cant help but think it’s something worse. like a brain tumor or something.
i am nearsighted so i do have blurred vision (bit with things close up like looking at my hands or something close to me) but recently i’ve noticed sort of vertical doubled vision? if i look at something i can see a little bit of a ghost image above it it’s sort of hard to explain. it’s only for far away objects and it’s worse when looking at letters like on a tv or poster. i read somewhere that this could be just from being nearsighted and it isn’t double vision. i also read on a forum where somebody thought they had a brain tumor to do the “pinhole test” where you make a small circle with your fingers and put it close to your eye and if the double vision goes away it’s an ocular problem and not neurological, which made me feel better.
i’ve had no headaches but bad memory and trouble focusing as well as the not feeling real feeling.
i kinda just need reassurance because health anxiety is a hard ass thing to deal with i’ve been terrified for a month of a serious medical issue!",Anxiety
"Possibly letting anxiety get to me? I am the type of poster that you will hate. I'm fully aware that I am 90% of the time just blowing everything out of the water with anxiety, it's been my MO for awhile.

I was at a bar talking to some women when we had to run my cousin back across the street to the hotel due to him getting into arguments. When we came back there were shots on the table for us and I really remember almost nothing after that. The only thing I remember is being in a car with one of the ladies and that guy being really grabby from the backseat.

Woke up at the lady's house the next morning and she dropped me off at my car. I've talked to her since and she's the guy did kiss me when we dropped him off. She said “you did get out to piss at one point and he followed you out. Don't know what happened but you were only gone about 45 seconds and didn't say anything when you got back in”.

That was last Friday night/Saturday morning. It's not Sunday and I have been sick as fuck. Sore throat, head stuffed up, probably one of the worst coughs I've ever had. Obviously the first thing that comes to mind to me is HIV. As far as I've been told from her nothing happened that night aside from the kiss part. I have since noticed that the condom from my wallet is gone but that honestly could have been gone for awhile before hand. I may have just forgotten to replace it. I would think if anything else happened I would be a bit sore the next day. I obviously know nothing about this person so their status would be unknown to me.

I know the general consensus will likely be that I am being overly anxious. But I know that I will not be able to calm down until I can be tested. Apparently HIV RNA tests are able to detect after 11 days? The only thing I can find about those is through this site: https://www.stdcheck.com/hiv-rna-test.php

And I'm not sure how trustworthy that is. Thanks in advance!",Anxiety

Scared to death of some wierd symptoms. Greetings. I have extreme health anxeity. For some time i have had troubles with floaters that looked like spiderweb. Recently these past weeks i have also noticed stars in my eyes. They seem to appear randomly and they also move with my eyes similar to floaters. They appear for some seconds then they disapear. I wen't to the eye doctor and he told me that i had PVD or occular migraine. He also told me that my right pupil was smaller then the left one so he called some neurologist and he did some tests but there was nothing wrong with them. But right now im starting to belive that he was wrong and that i have some super rare eye disease or maybe a brain tumor. Should i go back to the doctor or should i take his word that it is nothing serious?,Anxiety

8 months ago I had a viral infection which has since caused whatever chronic condition or disease I have.

\-Just want to add, my viral infection started with a bad stomach/lower abdomen ache 1-2 days before the actual infection (8 months ago), and I had a rapid heart-rate from right at the start of the viral infection.

My symptoms are:

\-Just want to start off by saying my heart-rate was high right from the very start of whatever infection i got, like from day 1.

\-Tachycardia through-out the day. Little things make my heart race (whereas before I was very fit), I wear a fit-bit and my heart-rate is very normal in the 60s when I am sleeping. But in the day time, when I am out, even if I am just seating my heart-rate is constantly around 110 BPM. And if I have anxiety it can easily go up to 140. And if I, for example, climb the stairs or jump around a bit, my heart-rate shoots up to 150, and if I go for a short jog (I can't because of my heart), but in 1 minute it is nearly 180 BPM. Due to how fast it beats I do not take part in any exercise. I had normal Echocardiogram, and EKG.. but I did that 5 months ago. I want to point out, for some reason when I am with my family at home my heart-rate is also normal if I am just seating. And it was also normal when I visited my cousins and when I was in their house, again just sitting.

Recently I had to attend a science lab for my university, and even though I was sitting my heart-rate was consistently around 110-125.

\-My systolic blood pressure has been evaluated since this chronic condition.. at 130-140, but my diastolic pressure has remained 80.

\-Lately, my chest feels more pressure and stress, and I think its because I put alot of strain on my heart throughout the duration of this whole thing. I visited a cardiologist 5 months ago and he said my heart everything was good.

\-For the past few days, it feels if I breath in very deeply my heart hurts, but not really sure where the pain is coming from

\-My only blood abnormality is a very high B12 at more than double the upper limit, 1476 pmol/L. I have measured homocysteine just now, and it was in the normal range at 9 umol/L. Not really sure why my B12 is very high, as I am not taking supplements and am a vegetarian.

My hands (for nearly 8 months) have blue veins appearing on the finger. very similar to the hand in this photo (but on the finger as-well): [https://imgur.com/a/n5V1XjC](https://imgur.com/a/n5V1XjC) .

\- I had muscle twitching and tingling which happened alot through-out the day, it has since gone down, but the tingling and twitching still happen at times. I had a normal EMG.

\- Leg muscles have gotten much weaker according to my wall-sit time and squatting. Prior to 8 months I could easily do a wall sit for 3 minutes, now after 20 seconds my legs feel unbearably sore, and they are shaking like crazy right away when I start a wall sit.

NORMAL TESTS AND RESULTS (all this are from several months ago, except the blood results posted above, those are from today. ): Normal: TSH, Blood CBC, LDH, ESR, CRP, PROTEIN ELECTROPHORESIS, abdomen ultrasound , Echocardiogram, EMG test, urine analysis, EBV, bicarbonate, chloride, creatinine , AST/ ALT, Potassium.

ABNORMAL RESULTS: Very high Blood B12: 1475 pmol/L (range is 200-600 pmol/L). Slightly low Iron and Vitamin D. I do NOT take any B12 supps when it was measured high, and I am also a vegetarian.

To summarize: I feel I have some type of post-viral autoimmune disease which causes High B12, Tachycardia, anxiety, and high-normal Neutrophils and monocytes. But I really have no idea what it is, or if it is even an autoimmune disease, etc.

"I hate this stupid disease. My HA first manifested itself when I was a freshman in college. I felt a coldness in my chest  on the way home for a weekend (probably a flare up of the anxiety I didn’t know I had,  triggered after moving away from home for the first time, dealing with college life and new workload, homesickness, my parents moved from my respective childhood homes, first childhood pet died, etc). 

I googled my symptoms and that’s where it all went downhill. Heart attack. All of the sudden I was sweating, shaking, chills, feeling of doom, lightheaded, I truly felt I was going to die. To the point I told my mom not to be sad when I inevitably died.


Later that night I had a two hour long panic attack. I begged my boyfriend to drive an hour to where I was to take me to the hospital to which he obliged. I missed my sister’s college graduation party sitting in the hospital getting laughed at and joked on by the doctors and nursing staff. “Did your boyfriend break up with you recently?”, “Are you on your period honey?”.

Subsequently that semester I went to the emergency room two other times. One doctor gave me an emergency script for Paxil. Never filled it. Never wanted to. 

Went to a cardiologist, my pediatrician, gastroenterologist, got an endoscopy, etc. I even slept at the foot of my dad’s bed for a week because I thought He could save me if I died. turns out I’m a perfectly healthy 21 year old, which is great until I started searching “healthy 21 year old surprise heart attack” and other similar things. 

The anxiety subsided after about 8 months. A few months later it resurfaced when I convinced myself I had bed bugs in my apartment. Called the bug people 5 times, hired private bug people (instead of my apartment ones), stayed with my mom for a few weeks, begged my best friend to move. No bed bugs. 

Eventually I healed from that two and recently (random itching and a few colds) has convinced me I had lymphoma. A headache recently convinced me I had brain cancer or MS. A bruise on the back of my leg has convinced me I have a deep vein thrombosis for the last three weeks. 


My anxiety has caused me to have a slew of unimaginable PHYSICAL symptoms:
Arm and leg pain
Itchy skin
Chest pain
Tingling 
Numbness 
Panic
Sweating
Shivering
Rashes
Stomach pain 
Twitching muscles
Headaches
Heavy head
Pins and needles
Back pain
Joint pain
Susceptibility to more colds and flus
Mood swings
fatigue 
Lack of appetite
Increased appetite
Missed periods

I hate this terribly debilitating disease. A disease most people will never understand. Convinced my family and friends don’t believe me and don’t trust me and don’t take me seriously, convinced the doctors must be missing something, convinced I’ll be that rare case that dies at 21 from a heart attack. 

The worst part? I’ve been doing well, healing. Taking care of myself. It always comes out of no where. Three months of stress, no symptoms. A month later it all catches up to me.

When will I stop being a slave to health anxiety? Checking, poking, prodding, literally self inflicting bruises all over me from constantly pressing on my body parts to check them for changes, pain, sensations.

Please give me your success stories and small  victories😭

"Anxiety stopping me from working I’ve been dealing with anxiety for a while now, I came to the realisation a few years ago that it has mainly stemmed from the relationship with my dad I had when I was younger. This is caused me to not be able to do tasks in front of people (wether they be simple or not) I just can’t do it. I start lightly trembling and thinking about how stupid I must look to whoever is watching me, this causes me to mess up even more. This is really stopped me from wanting to go out and get a job because I know that if the interview goes well (I actually do good in interviews weirdly) then I will eventually have to be shadowed and critiqued by someone while I learn the job. This dread has stopped me from going to 3 interviews now. Does anyone else get this? Sorry for the long post.",Anxiety

"Just feel so overwhelmed over ultrasound. Pleas talk to me.

My blood work came back fine except my testosterone was high. I started having a work up done on my ovaries and kidneys to check for tumors. My friend is a nurse at the office i was at and had the ultrasound tech check my kidneys extra well even tho it wasn’t a dedicated test for them because she knew i was afraid of a adrenal tumor.

"Crippling fear Hey guys, I’m posting this because I want to see if I’m the only one. My grandma passed on her hypochondria to me, and ever since I suffered a spinal injury my sophomore year of highschool I’ve been terrified of doctors visits and every little pain, ache, tingle, and spasm I get in my body. I went to a sports specialist for my back and he diagnosed me with a C5 fracture, and scoliosis. I can live with that. But after I became aware that my body is injured and no longer the same, I’ve been obsessed with the idea that I have cancer, a brain tumor, or MS. Usually it’s cancer that takes over my thoughts.

My thing is, I avoid the doctors office in every way possible. I HATE the idea of going to the doctor, being diagnosed, because to me my life is over at that point. I can usually talk myself through my panic episodes, but I usually seek the reassurance of others. I have a mole on my back and I’m convinced it’s changing, so every other week I ask my girlfriend if it’s changed and she says of course not. I can’t remember what it looked like as a kid, but I could’ve sworn it didn’t look like it does now. My anxiety is so bad I went to the doctor when I had a flu that wouldn’t go away, got chest x-rays to rule out pneumonia, and before my doctor told me the results I told him, “look, if I have cancer I don’t want to know, just don’t tell me” and he looked at me like I was crazy because the X-ray came back perfectly fine, just a common flu.

I’ve avoided the doctors office for so long now that I feel like there HAS to be something wrong. Terminal. I know I should go, but even thinking about the idea makes me shutter with fear. A lot of the posts I read on here are about people that go to the doctor too much, but I wanted to see if there were people out there that are like me.",Anxiety
"Some advice to my people Hello,

I've been suffering with anxiety and panic attacks my whole life, and while I take a ridiculous amount of meds for it including lorazapam, pregablin etc, I was informed about Magnesium and I wanted to share this with you.

So a lot of us get anxiety attacks triggered by the stress hormone cortisol, magnesium works by by stimulating the production of melatonin and serotonin which boost your mood and help you sleep. Magnesium also reduces the production of cytokines and cortisol, which lead to increased inflammation and stress.

It's important that you don't over do it as you can poison yourself with magnesium, and you also have to make sure it's aspartate, citrate, lactate, and chloride forms as oxide apparently doesn't absorb as well.

Speak to your pharmacist or Dr if you're mixing medication, but I have been able to reduce the amount of lorazapam I've needed since starting mag and its helped a lot with sleep. I'm truly impressed.",Anxiety

This is mostly fueled by any story of ""new chemical used in products and only 5/10/20 years later people confirm it's a carcinogen / otherwise dangerous"".

Because of this I get stressed out with chemical things like cleaning products, detergents, anything scented, general air pollutants, clothing dye, any drinking water, plastics touching food, heavily processed foods, and so much more. 

 I'm struggling to get over it because these cases do happen, and I wouldn't know there was a problem until it was too late; I can't shake the feeling it is rational to at least have some skepticism... but I know it's impossible to know about everything and I want to stop stressing out so much. any coping tips or advice would be great, thank you.

"Does this just sound like anxiety/depression? Hey! I know you guys arent doctors, and I am waiting for a call back from psychiatrists, but I was wondering if any of you guys have had similar symptoms and could give me some insight.

I feel like the way most people describe there anxiety is a lot different than how mine feels.

&amp;#x200B;

Sometimes I just get these episode where everything gets ""scary."" I just feel confused and very on edge and everything makes me jumpy. My life feels almost like a horror movie during these times. Usually a small sound (such as my fridge, PC, anything really) will seem to grow louder and seem eerie/spooky. My thoughts go down this loop of ""Do I have some sort of serious chronic mental illness, will I feel this way forever, will it get worse?"" And of course I try to shut these thoughts down and sometimes can, but the feelings are still there and very real. Sometimes I get very weird (and super brief) thoughts of doing rash things (flipping the fuck out on my grandma for example). It feels like there's an anchor in my stomach and sometimes, but not usually, Ill get shaky and have heart palpitations. These episodes last for well over 15 minutes and I never feel normal afterwards so I get annoyed when people label them as simple panic attacks, because they way other people describe there's, I feel as though mine are a lot different. 

&amp;#x200B;

Another thing to add, is over the summer I did acid for the first time, and I always read that acid will onset any mental illness you are going to get in the future. So I often fear that I did acid and fucked myself over because of it, but nobody on either side of the family has a history of schizophrenia or anything of the sort.

"Ear infection or something more? Hi all, this is sort of a follow up post from this: https://www.reddit.com/r/HealthAnxiety/comments/7xnd17/when_to_go_to_the_doctor_for_recurring_flu/

I woke up with ear pain this morning in addition to the other symptoms and I’ve had recurring ear infections for the past few years so I didn’t think it was related to everything else going on. The doctor said that it’s a middle ear infection and my lungs sounded clear, my throat looked fine, etc. so the fever and aches are all from the ear. While I was in the waiting room I went and replied to my post above. A few minutes after the receptionist called me up to the desk to get my doctors note for Work and when I got there I fainted—like full on blacked out, unconscious, woke up confused and surrounded by nurses, etc. I’ve fainted before but only when needles were involved. The doctor said I had low blood pressure and low blood sugar (probably true, I’ve had no appetite and have barely eaten) and the fainting was not because of the ear infection itself. I’m home now and my fever is still 100. I’m just worried because the ear pain didn’t even start until today but I’ve had the fever since yesterday. Do you guys think I need a second opinion or am I overanalyzing this?",Anxiety
"I fainted in a bar. Should I be worried?? I had a cold this past week and was getting better but feeling dehydrated 
Decided to go out drinking and ended up smoking some weed and having 5 beers
Was standing at the bar for about an hour and we ordered some bar snacks, about 5 minutes into eating I felt very lightheaded and nauseous, started seeing black circles, tried to make my way outside to get some air, and dropped to the floor at that moment 
I came to a few minutes later, sat at a table sipping water, and felt pretty much fine other than being kinda tired and still lightheaded

Could this have been just a routine fainting spell? I’m attributing it to dehydration, since I️ was sick, drank a lot of coffee during the day, and then drank alcohol, without really drinking any water. I also read that prolonged standing can reduce blood flow to the brain. I plan on getting checked out by a doctor this week. Should I be worried?

"Coping Methods Backfired Hi all, just hoping to get some feedback on how to proceed. 

I got an IUD in mid January, and had my follow up ultra sound in February. 

A few weeks after getting the iud, I started feeling this strange twinge in my lower left pelvis. Of course, having gone through this countless times, I began to do what I’ve been working on with my counselor, which is essentially using mindfulness to talk myself off the ledge of thinking I was dying. 

I actually felt relatively calm while I was having my exam, but then my doctor tells me I have a complex cyst on my left ovary, and I felt anxiety come crashing down on me. 

The ultrasound was 2/7 of this year, and since that day, I can’t stop obsessing over this cyst, and I’m determined it’s cancer and that I’m dying. 

My doctor even said it was nothing to stress about, and that I’d have a follow up in 2 months to see if it’s changed/gone away. That hasn’t helped, and I’m still so scared. 

It’s too the point where I’m getting heart palpitations, and every twinge of my body makes me feel like my ovarian cancer has spread to wherever I’m feeling it. 

Anyone have any advice? I feel completely at a loss, because I feel like I can no longer rely on my coping method.",Anxiety

"Back pain and worst anxiety day in years!! Crying and scared 33 female. I have been doing really well with health anxiety, not googling, going to therapy etc. NOT TODAY! i am terrified I have some sort of kidney disease or something. Last night when I went to bed at 1 am i was irritated with back pain, sort of mid back no matter how i moved, so I changed my pillow (my old one was giving me neck pain and headaches) and still no relief. I didn't sleep well. I have been unable to function all morning so far bc I can't stop googling kidney failure, infections, back pain etc.  I have sort of all over back pain, mid back, lower back, not sharp but achey and like i pulled something. I can really feel it when i take a deep breath or move. Sitting on my couch right now even hurts. I finally broke down and took ibuprofen. I also keep excessively checking my urine to see if its cloudy and keep moving and touching my back and checking for other kidney symptoms.  On sunday i spend several hours sitting on the floor going through several closets of clothing reaching and moving differently than normal. Yesterday I carried a heavy gaming system by myself from the floor to my car to the post office, I also used my lap top while sitting on my couch to work most of the day and evening....Is it possible this is from weird posture and will go away or should I be going to the ER????

"UTI...or not So I woke up on Friday having very mild symptoms of a uti, just a tiny bit of burning after peeing. I immediately drank a ton of water to flush. Afterwards the burning was barely noticeable but I know it was still there. Saturday morning I wake up and it’s still barely noticeable but still there so I make a doctors appointment. Unfortunately, my regular doctor isn’t in that day and neither is my usual back up so I book with the only doctor that’s in. At this clinic for as long as I could remember (I’ve gone here for over 10 years) they usually give you the results of the urine sample before you leave, keep this in mind that was the only reason I went because I convinced myself the only thing this could be is a uti or perhaps something worse even though I know I don’t have any of the symptoms but you never no right? It’s better to be safe. Anyways, she comes in and I explain my problem. At first she mentions it could just be irritation and she mentions something in particular that I do to dry my nether regions and I thought wow I could of actually cut myself or overwashed and a wave of relief washed over me. Because I do tend to overwash and use scented products. But then she said she would prescribe me a medication if I have a uti. She left and the nurse came in a few minutes later. The whole thing took 5 mins. 

The nurse comes back in saying I won’t have the result for three days and I’m confused so I call in the doctor. And she said there’s no harm in taking it even if you don’t have it. This goes against what my usual doctor says, she never suggests taking anything unnecessarily. 
Especially when it comes to a urine culture. Because of resistant bacteria or something. 
Anyways i left and picked up the medicine but it occurred to me she didn’t ask many questions...so that left me thinking it could be something else. Like a cut or a yeast infection or just being incredibly over washed. She didn’t even ask if I was sexually active or not or if I was having any other symptoms or if my period is due. 
But I was also in shock by how impersonal that visit felt as it’s not what I’m used to. 
So I have the medication but you know, me being anxious I don’t want to take it unless I have the results of the culture. At some moments it feels like I’m just irritated down there given what happened during the week leading up to these events. I quit using the regular soap I was using down there but I stilll used it for the rest of my body and if some slips down there it does burn. 

But sometimes I think omg did I just had a tiny muscle pain in my back is it an infection. Or regular body sensations freak me out. I’m really trying to relax but my mind keeps racing to all sorts of things :/ ",Anxiety

I am really suffering in a way that makes life absolute torture. I have health problems, however they're compounded *significantly* by my constant fears of death and cardiovascular/heart-related health anxiety.

"That awkward moment when your health anxiety was 110% accurate. Fml. I’ve spent my whole life not feeling right. My immune system has always been shit. Seizure activity as a child-teenager. Anyways, I’m 25 now and I had my adrenal gland removed a few months ago due to a benign hormone-secreting adenoma. It was found via MRI in October. 

Not even a couple weeks after surgery, I noticed extreme mental changes. Which led to paranoia. And then I lost 30+lbs and stopped sleeping completely. I would get SO angry over shit that wasn’t even important and I had to literally shut it down by cutting myself off from people. My hormones were a mess according to labs. I just KNEW something else was wrong.

A week ago today, I got an MRI which confirmed a brain tumor (of the pituitary). I have to have my concerns because I work in the medical field and I usually know what something is the second it starts creeping up. But I thought it was impossible to have another one present itself, even though my last tumor was benign. Fml.",Anxiety
"15 year old, Sophomore suffering from Health Anxiety ever since I was in elementary school. It's been inherently worse ever since I tried marijuana last summer. Haven't tried no other drugs since but still. It was a bad trip, i had wayy too much.

Current fears that have come and gone:

-Heart Attack
-Heart arrhythmia
-Cancer (Brain)
-ALS or some motor-neuron disease

My current goals are to gain more muscle and be overall more athletic. I want to get rid of my fat and gain muscle. And consequently after sitting in front of a screen for pretty much all of my life i have gained little to no muscle and am extremely weak. So for the past year i started with going for runs around my block and lifting small weights. Then when I got better I jogged for longer periods of time and got a bench press and heavier weights. So I have been lifting weights 6x a week and doing some cardio here and there. I hope i'm not overtraining. but now that my resting heart rate has dramatically decreased (went from 70-80bpm to now about 40-50bpm while resting) 

Scary shit. i don't want it to lower anymore... I'm scared it will just stop while i'm asleep cause it will go too slow and i will die. Irrational? Probably. Impossible? No. That's why all of us worry about this! All the diseases we can get, and death... don't get me started on that. Doesn't help I'm an athiest and have severe DPDR.

"Trying to be a supportive girlfriend of hypochondriac boyfriend Hi all! My boyfriend and I have been dating for over two years now and I always sorta joked about how he was a hypochondriac, but he’s shared some recent concerns with me and I’ve realized how severe his anxiety is behind it. A few weeks ago he was convinced he had ALS because of muscle twinges. Last night he shared with me that he’s terrified he has liver disease as a result of how much he used to drink in college. He gets down this long rabbit hole of searching through the internet and it drives me crazy because it’s not helping anything. And he refuses to get tested for anything because he doesn’t want it to be confirmed true. 

He has generalized anxiety on occasion and has started to go to a therapist but still hasn’t talked about these types of things with the therapist, which drives me crazy. We’re in our mid-twenties, live in a metropolitan area, and live a pretty healthy lifestyle, going to the gym frequently and eating semi-healthy. 

Im thinking about blocking sites like Mayo Clinic and webMD so he can’t search at home but I don’t know if that’s a mean thing to do.

Anyways, can you please share advice on how I can be the most supportive I can be? Or any advice I can share with him?? Thank you!!

"How did you overcome severe gym anxiety? Hello! I'm a gym newbie here, and I've been *really* struggling with going to the gym. 
I have no excuses anymore. I've been telling myself that once I move closer to a gym, once I get a good daily routine in, once I get a job that starts later, so on and so forth... well the stars aligned and I got a gym membership! No more excuses.

Except I've got some sort of gymphobia. I have always felt this way, even went a couple times as a teenager with my dad. I was freaked out then, too.

I went once with my boyfriend right after I got the membership and I wanted to cry the ENTIRE TIME. I was SO self-conscious, to the point it affected my movements. I wasn't focusing on lifting, I was focusing on being quiet, who could see me, how light my weights were, etc. I stared at the clock, couldn't talk louder than a whisper, clung to his side... It was a massive relief to leave and I subconsciously let out a huge sigh the minute the door shut behind us.

Tried going just to treadmill the other day, walked in and went straight to the bathroom because I was so ANXIOUS! There was only one treadmill being used but I was so worried he'd see me trying to figure it out. I got so shakey and almost started crying again so I left the bathroom and went straight home. 

I know for the sake of my mental health I need to overcome this, even if I find out the gym just isn't for me. This is absolutely my anxiety, particularly social anxiety and body dysphoria. What makes me anxious -

- being near other people working out (?!?!)

- seeing my reflection in the mirror

- using light weights (THEY ARE ALL LIGHT so I am just constantly anxious lmao)

- how long it takes me to set up/figure out a machine

- maybe someone else needs what I have and they are annoyed with me

- someone else using what I want and not know what to sub

- anyone talking to me in any capacity lmao

- my form (I'm new so logically I know it'll be incorrect but other people may judge me)

I'm tempted to shell out money for a personal trainer and a therapist. I'm sick of my anxiety and my body as it is, but I wanted to hear yalls advice.

Since this has been causing me so much anxiety forever, and it directly relates to my body dysphoria and anxiety, I feel like overcoming this is going to be a HUGE breakthrough for my mental health. I'd really appreciate your insight.Thank you!",Anxiety
"I feel like my psychologist might be ready to refer me elsewhere I have OCD with a health anxiety emphasis. My worries have run the gamut but I mostly focus on the idea of skin cancer. I have been seeing a psychologist for CBT and while in the sessions everything he says sounds logical and makes perfect sense. However, the second I encounter a mole I feel looks suspicious I don't apply what I've learned in therapy and I do everything wrong. I start by googling my symptoms and then when that doesn't work, I go to my doctor to seek reassurance. This assuages my fears temporarily but sometimes its not enough until the doctor will agree to a biopsy. Then inevitably the cycle continues.

My psychologist has been doing this therapy with me for months and I was doing so well until I tried testing myself and found a new mole. I was definitely not ready for it and this started a downward spiral where I feel like all the progress I made went by the wayside and I was back to how I was in the beginning.

Today I had a session after my most recent urgent care &amp; doctor visit. The tone was a lot different this time and I can tell he's frustrated with me because I am not using his advice. He kept saying, ""I am sorry that I haven't been able to get through to you to help you."" and has pointed out that I am not doing the work of not giving into my compulsions. He said that he didn't want to make me go through therapy if I wasn't motivated to do the work to get better. He's totally right. 


The positive that came out of this is that I am reflecting on my lack of motivation to do what I know I need to do to get better. I feel like I can prove myself to him from this point forward but I don't know that he's willing to continue treating me. Hopefully this next appointment isn't him telling me its the last one.

"Having a horrible HA week. This week my HA has just went flying back off the rails. It started with the usual heart palpitations, thinking im on the verge of cardiac arrest. Then i had a day of thinking i was gonna die of sepsis, for literally no reason at all. Like i didnt even have an injury. I keep washing my hands too much. Cleaning the absolute shit out of my house. And as of yesterday my head has settled back on the good ole fear of getting Rhabdomyolysis from powerlifting. Because i think i overdid training yesterday. I had a back injury that kept me from doing specifically squats for like almost a year. So i have been afraid to do them. Deadlift and bench are fine and i go heavy. But i have really only been doing squats on the high volume speed work day. I was doing pause squats with only 1 plate (per side) on the bar. Its way too light and i have been afraid to go heavier. So yesterday i decided to do box squats 10 sets of 2 with 30 sec rest. With 1 plate and one chain (per side). For resistance. It felt easy and i completed it and went on to do the rest of the exercises per usual. But then it sudden hit me that i did more weight with high volume than im used to on that particular exercise.  I do more than double that weight on deadlift, but still, thats not the same. And ill probably get rhabdo. Later on in the evening i felt nauseous and i think i have some pain in my quads. No other symptoms. But i read you could have it and have NO SYMPTOMS WTF. Idk if the nausea and migraine i got was from the major anxiety from the rest of the week leading up to this or from rhabdo. Im really trying to not do the whole panic and go to the ER thing that i always do when i get like this. Im ruining my sleep schedule that i worked really hard to fix (i have insomnia from ptsd), and i didnt want to sleep until i knew i didnt have it. Im still panicking over it today.

"I’m Afraid My Mom Might Hurt Me So the preface, I’m someone in my early twenties living with my parents. My parents have been fighting for years, occasionally physically. This would usually include my mom knocking in my dad’s door to argue with him. These arguments would usually start with topics that included bills, taxes, or myself, that would eventually escalate to more personal matters I will not get into too much here. I used to try to intervene when things got too heated since they can’t stop themselves, but recently I have decided not to so anymore as the last time I tried to intervene, my mom did physically attack  me (I didn’t get hurt, I was just standing in front of my dad and she lurched at me).

Last night, she called me to ask if I could knock on my dad’s door, since he wasn’t responding to her calls, because she “needed to pay a bill.” I knew that this wasn’t just about a bill, so I compromised and sent him a text instead, I even sent her a screenshot as proof. And I wasn’t going to call him/wake him up in the middle of the night unless it was an emergency, as I would consider it to be rude to do so. 

She then says “don’t worry your little head about, go back to sleep or whatever, okay?” 

Then, she called me again, this time saying “What are the consequences gonna be? Knock on the fucking door.” I declined, saying I don’t want to be a part of whatever was going on between them, and she should talk to him about this, to which she said “I know. He’s your loving dad, and I’m the evil mom.” 

I said goodnight to her, she laughs and responded with “not goodnight. Good bye.” 

I say that I will talk to her tomorrow, and she replies “I’ll never talk to you again. Not tomorrow, not the next day, or the next.”

She then calls me twice then immediately hangs up. 

She calls me one more time that night, here are the things she said when I declined to knock on my dads door again:

“I ask you to do one simple thing, and you didn’t do it. It’s just a simple thing! I tried calling your dad, and he isn’t answering me. It’s not like you’re picking sides or anything! Translation: “Look at what I do for you! And yet, you can’t this simple task for me? Well then I will rescind my love for you!”

“It’s not like you’re picking sides or anything!”

“You’re full of shit, just like him (my dad).”

“Where has your dad been all of your life?”

“You need to take responsibility.”

“Is this what one of your councilors told you to say, the one that I pay [x amount of money, I don’t exactly remember].”

“You don’t even know what is going on.”

“But fine. You can do whatever- go to sleep, wake up in the morning, do whatever you do.”

Me: “ok. Goodnight, mom.”

And finally, I said goodnight to her, and she said: “Don’t call me mom. Just say good night.”

That’s not to say my dads innocent either or anything - he’s hella toxic and has treated my mom poorly as well, so it is hard to tell where the abuse and victimization starts and ends between the two of them. Basically, they’re both each others abusers and victims, if that makes any sense at all. 

But I do believe he is the safer parent, as although he can, at his worst, make me feel very uncomfortable to be around him, as he is kind of an asshole at times, I don’t feel like my safety is threatened around him, unlike with my mom. He’s a lesser of two evils , if you will.

So I just feel really anxious right now. I did not want to be used as a pawn against dad, and my mom immediately associated me with him. So, now I’m afraid that when she comes home, she will start to treat exactly like she treats dad, or worse. I’m afraid she might start pounding my door and attacking verbally and physically. 

Okay that is all, I just needed to vent. Thank you for reading this.",Anxiety

Then again 2 days not and then on the 3rd day have a go at it. I started this 2 weeks ago and last week I felt a little ""pinch"" on my left testicle. It didn't hurt or anything it was just... uncomfortable but went away fairly quickly but that feeling only heightened my paranoia!!

I haven't felt that feeling since but I keep thinking about it and now I keep imagining I do have that feeling again.  I always constantly reach down there feeling them, and thinking omg one is bigger than the other! omg one feels softer than the other! I'm dying!

I want to go to the doctor but I also have a fear of doctors! I can't sleep. I'm undereating. I sometimes cry at night. I was never like this and I hate it. 

Last year I was paranoid about my neck which took me a while to get over and now it's below the belt. I just want to live my life normally again. ",Anxiety
"Is this a normal anxiety response? I’ve been battling with health anxiety for about a year now, and it’s been a rough journey. I’ve been stressed a little and I have a new symptom that I’m not sure is serious or anxiety???

For the past 2 days I’ve been having this vibrating/ buzzing feeling in my left chest. Recently I felt it in my left shoulder too. It happens about every 20 seconds and has been constant. I’m freaking out about it, and don’t know if I should see a doctor??? Has anyone experienced this? ",Anxiety
"Since December I had a complete breakdown in December, nearly a month to the day after writing my mom out of my life.  I am mid 30s, and my therapist said I have two ptsd triggers from childhood trauma, with my mother being the largest chunk.

The ER trip in December involved barking ""Help"" but feeling like I wasn't the one saying it, and randomly losing consciousness due to hyperventilating, and intense heart palpitations.

The heart palpitations and hyperventilating happened about 7 years ago as well, and I remember doing similar when I was a young kid.

I had another panic attack last week, and my anxiety has been up and down.  Hydroxyzine for panic instances, and prozac to keep me level.

My mind instantly goes to the worst places when my anxiety is high:  it's a stroke, a heart attack, a tumor, an uncurable/unknown disease.

Thanks to therapy, I'm no longer depersonalizing/derealizing, but this just means that staying in the moment involves powering through intense heart palpitations, fear, and cold/hot feelings.

The medication brought back a handful of dreams for the first time in more than a decade or two, but only for a week.  But now, I have had a handful of ""simple"" auditory hallucinations, such as a drum beat, a beeping sound, or the sound of water pouring, all of which are coming from in my head.

Has anyone had a similar mental breakdown after removing someone like a parent?  Work has been a stressor too, but my mom was the trigger, and work was the icing.  For months before this, I was frequently tired and not hungry at all, and always stressed at work, and had a short temper.

I just want to feel normal.  Right now, things are generally ok, but when that spiraling anxiety occurs, it's really hard to break free and feel like I'm staying sane.",Anxiety

"Hows do you differentiate between imagined problems and real problems? (Long rant) Since I was probably 19/20 I have had a roller coaster of health anxiety. It all started with an actual kidney issue which later resolved itself and the only possible cause was ""stress"". Since then I have had a huge fear of STI's which led to my ultimate fear of cancer and warts caused by HPV (especially throat/mouth). I have always had some form of anxiety, when I was younger I'd pull out my eyelashes and scour my face for blemishes. I believe this has led to me being so hard on my self that I notice any imperfection. I have tonsil stones and while I stuck my finger down my throat I went past my tonsils this time ( gross I know) and I felt a bump, almost like a skin tag. This led to me feeling so panicked  I became physically ill  and left work early. Since then I've been googling and come to the conclusion that I can't keep doing this to myself. Normal people do not stick their fingers down their throat to find god knows what. Of course It's going to feel weird down there.

I understand this new thought will not pass immediately but how do you guys differentiate real vs imagined issues? How do you calm yourself down? I am at my wit's end, my gf is too.

"Chest Pain Hi, I'm hoping you lovely people can help me with this.
I'm 21F, not super healthy but not overweight, just eat not-so-well.
A few weeks ago I got really sick for about 2.5 weeks. I had awful diarrhea, couldn't swallow, drink, eat, no appetite, was naseuas, had chest pains and had very high heart rates. Over this period I got 3 blood tests, a stool sample, 2 (abdominal) CTs (where you could see a bit of my chest), and a chest x-ray. Nothing came back positive. Eventually I started feeling better and started going on with my life. What may be somewhat important information is that my dad is a surgeon and I work reception for him, he had similar problems a few weeks before me.

For the last few days, I've had some loose-ish stools, a bit of weakness/fatigue, but mainly I'm concerned about a dull pain that moves around my chest. Today it's mostly been on my left side and about 30 min ago went into my left shoulder. Its not constant and it can be lower right, upper left, whatever.

"The grand old duke of hypochondria, he had 10,000 symptoms, and when he was only half way dead he was suddenly fine again! Ever feel like every day is an uphill struggle? You’re master and commander of a rebellious army of terrible thoughts that you spend all day corralling into a manageable format only for them to break ranks out of the blue and leave you exhausted and all out of battle plans? 

You would concede, surrender, wave your white flag, if you could. But when you’re fighting yourself, there’s no one to give in to, only a brief respite of broken sleep, spinning the roulette wheel of anxiety, will you wake up tomorrow with a new symptom or be granted a brief moment of peace? You pray for the latter and prepare for the former. 

Monday you wake up with nausea, the stomach cancer is back again. But, you also had abnormally painful cramps on your last period, so the logical explanation is that these symptoms are linked. The ovarian cancer from November is back and spreading, you were bloated last Friday too, if all makes sense when you put the pieces together. 

Pace the floor a little as you wait for the toaster to pop. Will I make a coffee? Hmm, the caffeine won’t help the nausea. Just stick to water and down your multivitamins, your antidepressants, the liquid iron for the self diagnosed anaemia. 

Palms are sweating, hands are jittery, a headache is setting in. Oh god, is this the blood pressure dropping or hypoglycaemia setting in? Only I could contract diabetes 15 minutes after learning of my terminal cancer diagnoses. 

The toaster pops, makes me jump a mile, heart racing.  Better check my pulse... great, a heart attack induced from the stress of my diabetes and cancer double blow. 

Dr google is ready to see you now.

“Nausea abdominal pain” *search* 

What is this, amateur hour? I’ve been coming to this doctor for 15 years, I know better than to be so vague with my symptoms. Better be more specific. 

“Nausea, shakiness, headache, sweating, dry mouth....”

No, no no. I’ll just be told it’s anxiety again. Far better to type in what I know it is and confirm my hunch with the list of symptoms that comes up. 

For the 300th time in a decade you search for heart failure, kidney infection, four different types of cancer, Parkinson’s, M.S, stomach ulcers, all the time internally scanning your body meticulously for developing symptoms... you’re so good at this now that you can feel the tiniest disturbance in your body, a twinge in your arm, the blurry vision when you look at a particular angle in a certain direction, is that a post nasal drip coming on? 

And the day speeds on, leaving you in the dust, an exhausted heap of worry and fear. The hours pass, commitments left to the wayside as you forge on in the pursuit of truth about your terminal condition. You’re grumpy, snappy, why are people trying to talk to you when you are clearly on the cusp of finding out without doubt you have 6 days left to live? 

Typing away on your phone or laptop, a partner or a parent curiously asking what you are up to “are you on Facebook, honey?”  You are short with them, you’re busy. Weighing up whether to tell them the truth, you’re dying again, knowing you will be met with rolling eyes or a speech about how you’re fine, to stop worrying. So instead you keep quiet, they think you’re in another mood, you’re always so moody. 

The night draws in and you’re done. You’ve scoured the forums, the articles, the YouTube videos. You still feel like crap, noticing you’ve a sore throat and swollen glands. Great, HIV too.

Until, just before bed you do what you always do. Find the others like you, wrap yourself in the thin fraying blanket of comfort that comes when you accept there are others all over the world who are dying today, who receive new terminal diagnoses every other week,  those poor souls who receive crushing news of an incurable illness like most people receive spam email.

Health anxiety. A seemingly uninstallable app rooted in your brain with new and exciting updates every day.

Your foe, your enemy, your captor. 

Tuesday and Wednesday go off without a hitch, you have no symptoms, you’re healthy for a couple days. Wednesday you caught norovirus from that person on the bus. Thursday it was gone but you woke up with Leukemia, how you managed to trudge into work after that blow was a miracle. Friday you were cured, Saturday the pinnacle of health, Sunday the cancer was back. 

And so the cycle continues. Held captor to a cruel brain (one with a tumour in it) that is so over sensitive to every bodily function, every twinge, that in its effort to inform your of your terrible illness, it’s slowly killing your soul day after day. 

 There’s hope for us yet. Once I went a whole month without silently battling a terrible incurable disease. One day that will be a couple months, then a year, and I’ll live like all the normal healthy people all around me. One day.

"how did buspirone/buspar make you feel? did you take it consistently or only as needed? hi anxious friends! i recently switched my meds from effexor to prozac and added buspirone 10mg for anxiety. my doctor told me to take it as needed, but after all the research ive done, this doesn't make sense to me. how would it even be effective if i only took it as needed, if it's not a fast/immediate acting drug? it builds up in your system over time, right? so i'd need to take it consistently for a long period of time to feel any effects? ill ask my doctor too of course, but im very interested in other people's experiences with buspirone specifically, and whether you took it as needed or daily. 

ive been taking 10mg 3x a day for about a month (with some missed doses in between) and i do feel less anxious, but the way my doctor described it made it sound like it was a fast acting anti anxiety drug that calms you down after you take a dose, rather than one that builds in your system over time. if it matters, i also take concerta and bupropion.

"Woo! Heart Woes. I’ve been dealing with bad heart palpitations since I was about 12 years old; my parents always told me it was anxiety attacks, as they run in the family.
In early February I had a bad anxiety attack with palpitations, which triggered about a 3 week period of time where my heart was just fluttering constantly, while I was laying in bed, trying to sleep, doing nothing, etc... I seriously felt like I was going to die, which then triggered a super intense depression like I’d never felt in my life. I finally gave in and went into Urgent Care once I had enough, where the doctor did an EKG and measured my resting heart rate at about 136 bpm. They urged me to go to emergency, so I did, and $1,000+ later they told me I was totally fine, my heart likes to jump around a lot but palpitations are normal and they recommended I start meditating. I don’t doubt the constant fluttering was probably due to health anxiety since I felt so scared from it. I took their advice, started meditating, got a breathing app, and decided to find a heart rate app to measure my bpm when it happens, since I’m never able to get into emergency when the palpitations are actually happening. It’s been giving me a little peace of mind to see what’s going on when I feel them and sometimes it’s not so bad as I feel like it is, my heart rate is usually 90-110 bpm, seems okay enough. It also helps me just to have a visual of whats going on. Anyway, after a couple more weeks of meditating, drinking lots of water and pulling myself out of my funk, I seemed alright again and convinced myself it’s all in my head.

Today I was shopping, bent over to pick something up, and it triggered really intense palpitations. My heart was pounding so hard that my entire body was shaking. I kept trying to calm down but had no luck- I remembered the heart rate app and pulled it out to see the severity of the situation. The app couldn’t even measure it for a minute, I watched the lines squiggling all over the place extremely tiny and just bouncing everywhere. Finally got a reading of 210 bpm, and so I sat and tried to calm down some more, and it finally slowed to about 160bpm, then about 10 minutes later I was back in the low 100s range. Now its been a couple hours and I’m comfortable in the 90’s. I’m super tired now but I feel like I handled it like a champ this time. It’s weird to experience a feeling like your heart is going to blow up but to have doctors tell you you’re fine. What a fun time :) Anyway, my sister says she knows of a cardiologist, I’m going to see if they’re accepting patients. I doubt I’ll get in anytime soon, since all the doctors in my area are booked out for months, but it is what it is I guess. Reading posts on this page and how other people deal with it has really helped me through all of this, so thank you everyone who’s shared their heart related stories!

"Brain tumor anxiety Hey everyone, I'm new to this subreddit. I feel like recently I've been suffering from health anxiety. It suddenly came up out of nowhere. First I was convinced something was wrong with my heart, I started having lots of different symptoms and was truly convinced something was wrong. Got it all checked, and it turned out fine. Afterwards I still felt kinda sick, so I got a blood test done which came back clear. This was about 3 weeks ago. 

A bit later I started having these headaches, and my vision suddenly got worse (at least I got the impression). Now I don't know if this is purely because I started focusing on it, or that it actually is something bad. Anyway, I decided to go back to the doctor since I work in IT, and dealing with the vision thing and headaches was getting pretty hard.

He checked me, asked lots of different things but he didn't seem quite sure about what it was. He sent me to an eye doctor, got my eyes checked there, and it turned out I need resting glasses for screen work ETC. (My eyes have been bad my entire life, had glasses since I was 3). I've also been having this visual snow, again I think I've had this for a long time, but it's like my mind suddenly seems to notice and freak out about it, same with things like my tinnitus which I've also had for years.

"My story with HA &amp; what has helped me! Hello, hello! Long-time lurker, first time poster. I first came to this sub like most of you, looking for other people who have experienced similar symptoms/reassurance. When I kept searching around, though, and reading people's posts about how they overcame their HA, that actually ended up helping me more than anything else. I've made a lot of progress in the past few months (much of it thanks to advice I've read in this sub!), so I thought I'd share some things that help me and a little bit about my story. 

I first started noticed my anxiety around health in my early 20s. I would take dozens upon dozens of pregnancy tests, convinced that they were all wrong and that I was pregnant anyway (even though I was on birth control at the time). I'd have headaches and get an MRI. etc. etc. You all know how it goes. I would Google myself into a hole until my anxiety was so bad that I started manifesting other physical symptoms. Then I convinced myself that those physical symptoms were also related to whatever I thought was wrong with me in the first place. It was a vicious, endless, painful cycle and I could not get myself out of it. It would go away but sure enough, when my life was stressful, it would happen all over again. 

A few months ago I had a panic attack in a cab on a way to a work meeting because I thought I was having a stroke and it was so bad that I had to get out of the car. I decided right then and there that I had to fix this thing. So, I tried changing some things. 

* I do. not. Google. symptoms. ever. I'm talking EVER. I put a note on my computer to remind me and everything. I do not do it. If I am feeling the urge to do it, I distract myself with a podcast or another task (I am online all day for my job, so if I can do this, anyone can).
* I remind myself that when you Google a symptom, you are asking Google's algorithm to show you the worst case scenario. And that is the result you are always going to get.
* I actually go to my annual doctor's appointments. I used to be so anxious about medical issues that I would avoid check-ups altogether. Now when I am having a minor symptom, I remind myself that I just went to the doctor and my tests/bloodwork were all fine. This helps.
* If a symptom persists for more than a few days, I make an appointment and I go. 99.9% of the time whatever symptom I was wanting to Google disappears within a day. 
* I read this somewhere on here and it really helps. Whenever I'm *not* feeling anxious (or sometimes when I am, if I can focus), I try to sit completely still and really appreciate all the sensations my body is feeling that I usually ignore. It helps to put my other ""symptoms"" in perspective. There are millions of things going on in your body at all times. Obviously sometimes you're going to notice something every now and then. That doesn't mean you're dying. 
* This one is what I struggle with the most but I REALLY try to not scroll through my phone before bed. Putting it on airplane mode and reading a book instead has done literal wonders for my mental health.

"I'm Going Crazy (Brain Tumor fear) Hey guys.
(Sorry if my grammar may seem a bit choppy. English is not my first language). 
I'm running into alot of anxiety. I feel like I'm losing my mind at this point. 

I have been experiencing neurological symptoms that seem to come and go by months. It all started on Thanksgiving. The very first symptom was a strange headach. It was dull yet slightly painfull. What followed afterward was strange weakness feeling in my sholdure and jaw. These symptoms suddenly went away the after. A week I had expreinces no symptoms. In the beginning of December, I began to experience these same symptoms again. 

All day I could not keep my mind off of these symptoms. I eventually succumbed into a full blown panic attack. Those specific moment felt like I was about to die. 
The symptoms continued throughout the month of December. During this time I was able to go to my family doctor. He seemed to shrug it off.
They took my blood, which turned out to be normal. 
My anxiety not stopping either. These symptoms would occasionally relive than come back. There are period where these symptoms would become stronger and new ones will form. I began to expreince strange dizziness. My balance also felt slightly off. I could not keep my mind off of it. 

After Christmas, my symptoms seemed to have completely vanished. The symptoms seem to have been gone for a good month or so.  Somehow everything felt better and I thought that was the end of that.  

Boy was I wrong. 

The symptoms all returned. And back came my anxieties of impending doom. 
I did notice that these symptoms returned when my period was beginning to start. It did get worse when I was on my period.... I don't know if that matters. 

I'm still very worried that I have a brain tumor. I feel like that my family and friends think im going crazy, but they just dont understand. I'm scared and have no where to go... ",Anxiety

"I moving in with my best friend and my partner who I love. But we all have a lot of issues (nothing abusive or unhealthy to each other) and one of my roommates especially has a lot of trauma centered around moving and its going to be rough for them and my other one tends to internalize anything wrong or stressful about the move onto themself as their fault because they feel like they pushed it the most. In the end this is actually the best decision for us, and we just need to weather the storm. Any advice on how to support them the best? I myself have pretty serious issues with depression, and anxiety stemming from BPD and ADHD.

"So I have basically come to accept that I have BPD. I have everything but a formal diagnosis which I know its bad to assume but after conversing with a friend of mine who is licensed to give out diagnosis as well as talking to someone who also has BPD and there words on the matter being ""you have described yourself the same way I did when I got diagnosed, as well as described feelings I have about myself that I have never found the words to do"". I think assuming is fair at this point.I am now looking back on some of my recent actions through a new lenses and taking responsibility for the things I have put some of my idealised people through which has recently left me with nothing.My actions recently stripped me of my job, friends who I can spend any meaningful time with, partner and housing. I was too wrapped up in desperation to try to fix it all. I am currently working through a program which suggests finding things to be happy about which at the moment is a struggle to lean on any aspect of my life considering; socially, professionally, personally and romantically everything went up in flames all at once.For instance the program recommends focusing on work which I cannot do because even trying to apply to jobs I am so desperate that I am getting nowhere. It suggests expanding your social circle but I have no friends left to even begin to introduce me to new circles (that are savoury atleast. I have many drug abusing people who would be willing to let me come along but its not a group I feel I am myself with which is something I want to avoid). Romantically I am fine leaving off the table for a while but it does mean finding somewhere to live is impossible without friends/a partner to move in with. My family is all kinds of toxic as well which would hinder my mental health further using them as an asset in any kind of way.Going to events to meet like minded people is impossible due to me not having any money etc, etc.I feel like all these aspects are butting against eachother, and as hard as I search for action plans they all seem to revolve on one of these aspects which I do not really have any of at the moment. I just need a way out really. I am trying to stay optimistic on rebuilding my life but whenever I sit down to attempt it it seems more and more impossible which just leads me back to despair.

I am now crying because my MIL claimed that I had said several negative things about my husband (her son) last night and I honestly do not remember/recall me saying anything negative about him. I tried asking for specifics (maybe to help jog my memory) and she did not respond. I think the part that hurts a lot is her saying that I should be thankful that he got me and the kids through the past year and a half and doing the cooking cleaning and majority of the child care whereas most dads do not. I know this but to say basically that I am not doing enough for the kids or the family really hurts. she is supposed to be picking up the boys for me so I could have some me time but now I am feeling guilty about it. And angry and I feel like I have had enough. Called the husband. He has suggested that I work on my project for an hour or so to calm me down. I am going to try that to see if it helps. Anyway thank you for letting me vent. Just when I thought I was doing better,Depression
"I am going to start from the beginning of the year and work backwards. so 2021 has been nothing but a continuous ball of shit for a few reasons. broke up with my bf, had to quit my job because of a rage incident, got on meds, got off meds, was hospitalized, got pretty suicidal, cut people off.. nothing but a whirlwind of self harm. its funny because the majority of my depression is not caused by anyone or anything, but my failure for self love and self care and denial in self worth. here is the tragedy.. I grew up with a very happy childhood/teenagehood . loving parents, a loving family what most people would kill to have in this world. but because of my self hatred, I wanted to prove myself to them and to my friends that I was not the cheery innocent kid I once was. so what did I do? I try to be asshole by cutting them off. being mean, blocking them, getting angry at them for no reason etc. To prove to them of a false sense of power that I lack within myself. But the worst part of it all becoming addicted to that mean streak against people. Which has led to irritability.. and now.. addiction to pain. Anyway, that is like 5% of the whole story. I have practiced self destructive behavior pretty much my whole life. Not tapping into myself when I should.. letting life takeover before my eyes. Nothing but a overwhelming subconscious laziness. Like living in a giant daydream. but it did not really matter up until I was about 23-24. why? because my parents did everything for me. gave me a car, gave me money every day, filled up my gas tank every week, filled my lunch box up until senior in high school. so part of me constantly living in la la land was the luxury of literally everything being done for me. and now here I am finally trying to take a stab at life at 25 and I cannot even find my way out of a m****f*** paper bag. I cannot follow through with my decisions for the life of me, my goals do not hold value, etc its a vicious cycle that never ends. and now I have anxiety that time is running out by getting serious about my life at 25-26. The rather be dead thoughts chase me 24/7/365. And I cannot escape myself no more. but I do not blame my parents fully. of course I take responsibility for continuing to practice that day dream life style. but at the end of the day its no ones fault. I do not like to look at it that way. what is done is done and I am in the present and that is all that matters. and now I have to undo my wrongs. my bf broke up with me two weeks ago for my impending suicidal ideations, and inflicted pain I caused him and his best friends. my threatening to shoot myself etc. It took a hold of our relationship so much that he was afraid to drive in my car because he thought id kill us. he was scared. and I cannot barely live with the fact that I scared someone that I loved so dearly. And it will haunt me to the day I die. because I am not that type of person and I always have good intentions deep down in life. So I was hospitalized because he wanted me to get help and I wanted to better myself. But it did nothing besides give me a new pill which did make me feel better ill admit. But I recently quit therapy and the pills because why? because I decided I do not want to live my life by not being able to help myself. I have the what kills you makes you stronger mentality. do I think I am crazy and does my parents think I am crazy for stopping treatment? yes. am I doing me harm by doing this? yes. am I digging myself a deeper whole by doing this? yes. but some odd reason I think its necaaary because I am tired of my 10years of therapy and going on and off of meds. so I am currently seeking more natural and less expensive treatment to better myself. one of the last things is.. I cannot hold a job. look, I am an artist/influencer that is trying to make it in the music industry. I have been in music since 8 years old and know its my calling. however, I cannot do the bullshit get-by jobs anymore. I am 26 now and want to do what I am made to do. not folding burritos at a damn chipotle, not slave work making box walls at UPS, and not parking peoples cars for them just so they can throw a $1 at my face. I think I have been through about 12-13 jobs since I was 16. and I am sooooooooooooooo sick to my stomach over it. it lowers my self worth and confidence and I am exhausted. I am jobless right now because I broke down at chipotle in front of a room full of customers glaring me and my coworkers too for basically cursing out the store and having a psychotic breakdown that could have easily be resolved by taking my complaint civilly in the managers office one to one. but no, it was the last straw. but what was it really? it was just a cry for help from within. this was right before my bf found out and wanted me to get help and before i got on meds. and none of it was to make the workers feel bad, or to be an asshole.. no. absolutely not. I also have a lot of self esteem issues so whenever I feel the heat boiling.. I let it go because I am passive aggressive generally and the only way I can hve a voice is by letting it come out through anger (horrible I know). just more self destructive behavior that I practice. but at the end of the day man I am finished with exhausting myself of this illness. I want to be dead. I do not want to be alive. I rather be dead than causing this pain amongst myself every damn day and trying to fix it. its too much. just too much. and a pysch ward do not do shit. I was there. I am so lost in this life. if there is anyone out there who struggles with self inflicted pain or feels behind in their lives or is addicted to feeling pain or have lost all self pride.. please respond below. id appreciate it. thanks for reading for anyone who cares to read",Depression

"I feel like I never stood a chance I was made fun of over my appearance ever since I was young. I was just a child and had poor self esteem and confidence even though I didn’t know about those concepts yet. I was afraid to interact with others and felt like everywhere I went, people were laughing at me. This lasted all the way until I graduated high school. 

Years of maturing and some plastic surgery later, I don’t feel as self conscious but the damage has been done. I hate myself. I feel grotesque and worthless. I want to die so that I stop feeling this way. I constantly wonder why the universe would allow me to come into this world and live like this. Am I being punished for something I did in my past life? 

I have tried therapy but the “relief” was only brief. I would take a picture or catch my reflection at a different angle and be reminded just how ugly I am. I want to accept it but it’s so hard. I find myself mourning my younger self and it makes me even more depressed to know that there was no hope for me from the start.",Depression

"Hi all,The last few years have been awful to me. Although I am 19 and at a very good university, life is so tough right now. I was diagnosed with depression 5 years ago, not because of any external factors, but just because me lmao. My family has always been fine, and we are close and supportive, and my friend groups over the years know what is happened.The past 4 summers, however, have been awful and I am losing everyone I love.3 years ago, I had a complete mental breakdown over my thoughts spiralling, and nearly committed suicide. I did not tell any friends about this, and was too mentally exhausted to socialise over most of the summer, and I lost many friends by just not seeing them.2 years ago, I broke up with my girlfriend. It was sad as any breakup is, but was made worse by false rumours she had made about me. We broke up just entering into summer break, and that summer was really tough. I worked on myself over summer, but I became very anxious about what everyone thought about me, and I lost a lot of my humour.Last year, of course covid hit, so we were in lockdown, which was isolating. Just to add fire to my already depreciating mental state, my dad was diagnosed with laryngeal cancer in April. Thankfully that is one of the safer cancers to have, but I would not ever wish the experience on anyone. Over this summer, he had rounds of radiotherapy and scans and it was so stressful. I joined uni later this year and, although I made a fair few friends, my dad was always on my mind and I could not enjoy myself as much.This summer, I have been framed for a completely horrid allegation, and the investigation process is so painful and mentally exhausting. I am trying my hardest to stay positive but it has taken away my social battery completely, and once again, summer has not been kind to me. To add to this, my dad had gotten a recurrence on his cancer, and his voice box had to be taken out, and he was in hospital for 2 months recoveringHas anyone else had years of just horrible stuff happen, and what advice can you give to try and get through all of this. Also, what professional help do you think would be appropriate (I have tried antidepressants but i did not like them) Sorry for the long read, but thanks How do you look past all of the bad things life gives you",Depression

Fuck knows what will happen next, Ill drag myself to work, become my shadow until things get easier but these days it never seems toFuck it Fuck it",Depression

"This is going to be my senior year, and I see all these classmates hanging out and having fun. I wish I had that. I reminisce of the times I was able to do that, with my friend group, in middle school. And I cry thinking about how Ill never experience it ever again. We were close, but of course friendships fade especially when you go to different highschools but we still hung out every now and then, but now I know we will not. I do not think any of us have reentered such a tight knit friend group like we had before, and since our friends passing we just realized we would never be that tight knit group anymore. I wish I had that support system, I hate feeling lonely now. I see classmates posting about them going bowling and playing at Dave and busters. I hate them, I hate that I cannot have what they have, I hate my life. I have contemplated suicide before but I have never acted upon it, today is the first day that i selfed harmed.

"I could not sleep tonight so I wrote it out and threw it into the void hoping that will help somehow.""what is your name?"" I ask her""I am your rival,"" she replies I pushed myself further back into the old red pews, they squeaked at my movement. The guy beside me stared at his phone. ""I do not remember you,"" I say.""What happened to you?"" She asks me.I look down at my hands. I do not want to be here, i do not want to have this conversation. I barely wanted to come into this building in the first place. I snuck up here to avoid the other kids my age. The guy beside me looks up at the girl with a calm but stern expression. He does not seem too excited about randon conflict popping up out of nowhere.""Dawn, it does not matter,"" he says. he is Asian, my guess is Philippino. His hair is short, he is about 5.8, muscular build with the aura of ""confident athlete church guy"" if that is a thing. ""You remember her, do not you?"" Insists Dawn. The guy frowns. I lower my eyes, feeling deeply self conscious. This is why I did not want to come here in the first place. Back in this place so much of who I was was shaped here. I stood on that stage and will always vividly remember making people laugh so hard their faces were red. I got second place. I was 11. I lost to this girl, I guess. I did not even remember her name. I think she sang that song from Walk To Remember. She must be older than me. I do not know why she thought I was her rival. Although i was clearly better than her on that stage she did win the talent show so who really cares?""Some things happened to me,"" i say. ""Who did this to you?"" She asks leaning her face in closer.Why is she still talking to me?""Whoever it is I am going to go after them!"" She says. I frown. That does not mean anything to me. People think I look so different, so much darker, hide in the corner and keep my hat or hood over my face, and avoid performing unless I have to, is because I was raped or beat up at work but I was not. And I do not want anyone to harm those who made me this way. I think, anyway. ""I am sorry to disappoint you. I am not the rival you wanted,"" I say.She sits down beside the guy shoving me over closer to the edge of the pew. The guy puts his arm around her shoulder, I guess they are dating. I sigh inwardly. I was supposed to be like that, you know. I was supposed to be in the cute church couple with the pretty voice and the charisma. I was supposed to be on Dawn's level. Turns out I am some antisocial emo chick still in her room reading manga with her headphones in and a keyboard. Please do not look at me, Dawn. Please do not scrunch up your nose and make it so obvious that I am not the same person I was. I am sorry I disappointed you. I cannot bring myself to tell you about it, and you have not earned it anyways. It does not really matter, it is just defined me and completely remade me into whatever this is. I am not your rival anymore. I do not belong here anymore. Please do not sympathize with me. I do not want it. do not be angry, do not be sad. do not be anything. Forget me. Forget who I made laugh, forget every cringey, funny, cute, strange thing I did here. I only came here to learn and sing quietly. I came early to find my seat to avoid such interactions. I get up, I feel anxious squished by the perfect couple. I do not remember where I went. Just the corner of the room, like a theater in that room I was not supposed to be in anymore. I hope you win again, Dawn. I hope we never meet again. I feel guilty for how I turned out after trauma and last night I had a vivid dream about it. it scared tf out of me",Depression

"TW. suicide, death Unintentionally. Backstory, I have been on SSRIs for almost 2 years and never skipped a dose. Yesterday however was the first time. I was feeling relatively normal that morning, but as I went out with friends in the afternoon, I remember feeling... a bit glum. I totally forgot I have not taken my meds, so I thought it was just one of those off days. All I can think of that time when I was with them, however, was I felt out of place. My friends were not even talking to me that I felt even more miserable. Granted that anyone would feel the same, I chalked it up to me being timid and not engaging in the conversation. But on that afternoon, I just felt like I was intruding on a somewhat closed space that I was not allowed in. My laughter felt forced and I was not enjoying myself. I almost wanted to cry that my best friend was a little awkward around me that I knew something was wrong and it was because me. I felt like I was a defective pos and that I deserve what I am feeling because I am sick and I am never getting better. I cried that night and thought of committing suicide again. I had tons of suicidal thoughts when my dog got sick and died (I cannot handle grief very much) and it has been 3 months since then. Last night was so downright depressing, I felt like someone died in my family again. I live alone and I cannot trust myself to make decisions when I am horribly depressed, so I decided to go to sleep to maybe cleanse the feelings away. This morning, my family called and asked me what I was doing. They asked if I took my meds. I counted the ones that were left, and knew right then: yesterday, I did not. I got scolded for a while, but it was okay. I took my meds then and placebo or not, I feel a lot better. But still, I kind of realize that I might forever be on SSRIs. A day of not being on it just does things to my brain that I cannot explain. TLDR. Skipped my meds accidentally, got too depressed I wanted to commit suicide. Reminded to take them the next day, felt better (placebo or not, who knows). do not skip your meds, kids. I skipped a dose of antidepressants and it was horrible.",Depression

"My brother has been struggling with suicidal thoughts since March of this year. Before confiding in me, he had been seeing a therapist and had not gotten any better. He was struggling to sleep at night so I slept with him every night for two months. I let him vent to me, he cried in my arms and Id wait for him to fall asleep before I did. Unfortunately I had to put my life on pause for all of this so that I can help him out as much as I can. After multiple failed suicide attempts, I decided to Baker Act him for three days until I found a facility that could house and treat him. While hospitalized, he was put on antidepressants and has continued taking them since then. After he was released from the hospital I had him stay in a treatment facility for about a month. He stopped sleeping there but he continued to go the facility every weekday for about six to eight hours. After receiving treatment from this place for a few months, he says he has not gotten any better. Since the start of all this he has become so heartless and cold towards me. He told me the only reason hes alive is because killing yourself is very difficult and hes failed every time. I begged him to promise me he will not try again and he says he cannot make that promise. I love him more than I can put into words, and every time I tell him that he does not say it back. I feel like I have tried everything I can. I am desperate. I do not know what to do. Apart of me feels like its time I take a step back because maybe I am being overbearing and I need to let him figure this out on his own. This has taken so much of a toll on me that I have had to seek therapy, as well. I do not know what more I can do to help him.

"I can’t think of another reason why i am the way that i am, can you guys share your experiences I’m on medication and i do all the things people recommend, i got a bike for university so that i’d stop being sedentary, i try to keep my room clean and i even force myself to go out with friends and socialize.

But i realized i don’t enjoy socialization, they say humans thrive on socialization, but I don’t feel that I do.

People feels like a chore for some reason I never really miss my friends or miss going out with them.
Every time they ask me to go out I make up an excuse and humor them and on the rare occasion i did go with them I would go home early. They will try to prolong the outing as much as possible. Maybe have a couple of drinks and play video games late into the night but I genuinely can’t find it in me to wanna be around them and it isn’t about them as people they’re actually very sweet and accepting wonderful people. 

They are kind hearted and patient and one of them even cooks for us sometimes it isn’t about them. I’m not sure what’s wrong with me but I just can never seem to enjoy being around people it’s supposed to be healing to be a part of a community to feel like you belong, to go out with friends and to get out of the slump you are in. 
 
A lot of people tell me it’s not good to lay in bed all day or to be in inside your apartment, watching YouTube and movies and playing video games alone but I genuinely feel that I don’t have the same functions that other humans do I don’t have the thing that makes me want to be around others. It just isn’t an emotionally fulfilling experience. 

I don’t feel the need to be around other people and whenever I do go out with people, I look forward to just going home and relaxing and finally breathing and doing whatever i want.
I’m not sure why maybe it’s a personality clash? Maybe I just haven’t found my “people“ or someone that really understands me to the point where I would find their company enjoyable? I’m not sure all I know is I’ve never really had a friend that I wanted to spend that much time with if it were up to me, I would go weeks maybe even months without ever hanging out with friends even though I know it might be better for me mentally if I’m around people and put myself out there and meet new people as well but I genuinely do not crave human presence in my life and the happiest or at least the most content I’ve ever been is when I’m alone reading comics and drinking coffee in my bed.

It isn’t like I don’t want to have friends I really do, when I have friends I just don’t really see their presence or company as a priority or a need in my life other than a conversation every now and then I never really seem to want to spend my free time on them.

I’ve been like this my while life even during middle school.

I yelled at the guy to stop and he did but it still made me uncomfortable.A few months later I decided to come forward and talk to a teacher from my school about it in hope that she would help or at least do something. One of my close friends came with me to talk to the teacher as I did not feel strong enough to talk to her alone. My friend and I talked to the teacher, let us call her Mrs. X, and at first, Mrs. X seemed understanding and supportive. Later that day Mrs. X pulled me and my friend out of class to write down a few things to back up my allegations. I made a witnesses list as other people had witnessed my being assaulted. This was followed by my witnesses being interviewed and giving details.On my final period on a Friday, I was pulled out of my class and Mrs. X pulled me into an empty classroom and sat me down. For the next hour, she ran me through about how I was lying and that one of the witnesses had told her that I was lying and just did not like the guy who assaulted me and I was doing it all for a laugh. As anyone would, I sat in that classroom and cried. Mrs. X believed one witness and not the victim. Then came the scariest thing I had heard, ""You will likely be charged with false reporting of sexual assault and will have a permanent criminal record"". Now I am a good person I have never got a detention or anything but I would not say I am the teacher's pet but still, of all the things that I thought could have come from me coming forward this was not one of them. &amp;#x200B;I spent the whole weekend in fear. I could not afford to have a criminal record. I had not even told my parents about it. I was so angry at my school for doing this to me. I know that I was sexually assaulted and I would never ever make things like that up. I was furious but also very scared of what would happen next. I heard nothing about the situation till the next Tuesday, two weeks after I came forward. Mrs. X pulled me out of class again and into her office. She told me that the guy's family did not want to give me a criminal record or charge me. Then she looked me in the eye and said that I was a lair and that I was overreacting.&amp;#x200B;Overall, Mrs. X still does not believe that I was assaulted. And I am thankful that the guy's parents were nice enough to not send my life into a downward spiral. i got in trouble for being sexually insulted",Depression

"Honest. Not trying whine. I literally have no one else to talk to. I really am just over it. I have two out of four of my girls that I am hanging around for. My oldest just had an attitude all the time. I get it you are 20. My 18 year old is disabled. So most of her care falls on me. Totally fine with. My 17 year old is a narcissistic brat and lives with my parents in another state. My 9 year old is so young. All my kids have great qualities about each of them. My husband and I have been married 22 years this year. And he absolutely hates me I feel. I love him. But he has never been sweet to me since we got married. Now I have made a mistake in our marriage, I am not perfect. Neither is he. He was so mean all the time. I felt so terrible and when someone else makes you feel nice, you run towards, even if its wrong. But it has been 17 years since then. I take care of his medications. And I help where I can with appts. I take care of the kids. I work full time, crap hours. I barely function. When I ask for help I am seen as weak. I am trying to not show I am sad at all. I try to be everything to everyone. My oldest has attitude and wants to move out or whatever. I have a great job at the hospital. Its the hours that kill me and give me tremendous mom guilt because I am so tired and try to get some sleep but not everything gets done. I think my co workers like me. I am such a people pleaser. Its nuts. I am not trying to look for compliments. But damn I do so much for everyone, and no one gives a crap. My husband says I am lucky to even be where I am. I would have nothing if it was not for him. The only that would truly miss me is my 9 year old. Because she is the heart of us. The 18 year old would be put in a home if I died. The 20 year old would be pissed but get over it. The 17 year and my parents would be like what took so long? How did she ever live past Robyn? My birth mom. I am adopted by my aunt and uncle. My husbands sister, who I was so there for her when she went through cancer out of no where quit taking to me two years ago. I have not spoken to my parents since my daughter went to live with them. Everyone seems to forget that I am the one they went to for everything. Childcare, money, advice. So I make one mistake, and I am a piece of shit forever? No one helped me when my husband was hitting me. I actually met with my dad at a restaurant. He would not even let me and my kids come home. He said stick it out. So here I am 22 years later. I love my husband. I do sweet things to try and get affection. All I get is what I think he has a girlfriend. I honestly do not care. I just wish I was treated like a person. I work my butt off. My husband spends so much time and effort looking for records he wants to buy. On his phone!!!!! I hate smart phones so much. He is on his so much. I have mentioned before that the whole house is not on a device and no one listens. I really hate how not a single person in my life can actually be nice to me except my disabled daughter, most days. And my 9 year old. Those two are the only reason I am still here. because I would rather not. There is so much more. Now I know worse things happened to other people and i should not be whining about anything. Thanks for taking the time to read. I do wish you a great day of sunshine So over it",Depression

"For the past two months I have been feeling like actual crap for no reason. No big life changes (besides starting to drive and getting a job) have happened. For whatever reason I just feel sad. I am a overweight person that used to just eat all the freaking time, but about a couple weeks ago I just stopped eating. I do not ever feel hunger whatsoever. I lost 20 pounds already. I am not ashamed of being heavier its just that I literally just do not want to eat. The only reason why I even get out of bed is to get ready for work. When I am off I just lay in bed and do nothing. Do I have depression?",Depression
"Does anyone ever feel like your childhood, and your teen years were stolen from you? Mostly because of factors your could not control? Some factors you probably could control but you did not realize till it passed? Like having toxic parents, anxiety and depression coming from those parents, overbearing mother, who stopped me from playing sports, who made me very reserved, who forced me to hang out with kids I never liked. My low self esteem and low confidence, and a depression that grew even worse, then finally a terrible breakup, one of which you are still not fully recovered from. Even 3 years later. Everyday is a waking nightmare, there are small moments of peace but everyday is a struggle to get though. I wish I had a time machine to relive my childhood and teen years. I am so fucking depressed I fully believe I will never get better. Anyone else relates? I want my childhood years",Depression

"If you’re wondering whether adverse childhood experiences are negatively impacting you as an adult, you probably already know the answer. In my work as a hypnotherapist most of my clients are mature adults experiencing issues rooted in anger, anxiety, depression - or a mixture of these. Often, they are wondering if their present issues are linked to their childhood experiences. More often than not, the answer is yes. 

Research carried out since the end of the last century has led to a greater understanding of how adverse childhood experiences impact on long term wellbeing – both physical and psychological. The key findings are:

· Childhood trauma is very common: even in so-called well-to-do areas.

· There is a direct link between childhood trauma and chronic disease in adulthood.

· The more types of trauma a child experiences, the greater the risk of them of experiencing social and emotional problems as adults.

· Those who experience childhood trauma often experience more than one type of trauma.

You can calculate your own ACEs score by responding to the following questions. Give yourself 1 point for each question where you experienced that category of trauma before your eighteenth birthday. 

1. Emotional abuse: Did a parent or other adult often or very often insult, demean, belittle, humiliate, verbally assault, or threaten to physically assault You? 

2. Physical abuse: Did a parent or other adult often or very often grab, slap, push, or hit You? 

3. Sexual abuse: Did a parent, adult, or someone at least five years older than you ever touch your body in a sexual way or attempt or have oral, anal, or vaginal intercourse with You? 

4. Emotional neglect: Did You often or very often feel that no one in your family loved you or thought you were important; or your family did not look out for each other, feel close to each other, and support each other? 

5. Physical neglect: Did You often not have enough to eat, had to wear dirty clothes, had no one to attend to your medical and dental needs, or had no one to protect you? 

6. Loss of parent: Were your parents separated or divorced, or did you lose a parent for any reason? 

7. Domestic violence: Did You often or very often witness or hear violence between your parents or other adults where someone was being grabbed, shoved, slapped, hit, kicked, had something thrown a them, sexually attacked, or threatened with a weapon? 

8. Family member with addiction: Did You live with anyone who was a problem drinker or alcoholic, who used illicit drugs, or who was addicted to any other substances? 

9. Family member with depression/mental illness: Did you live with anyone who was depressed or mentally ill, attempted or committed self-harm and/or suicide, or hospitalized for mental illness? 

10. Family member incarcerated: Did you live with anyone who went to prison? 

ACES Score (0-10) = 

As ACE scores increase, so does the risk of disease, social and emotional problems. With an ACE score of four or more, things start getting serious. While studies in different locations return slightly different results, the figures suggest around 11% of the population have experienced four or more adverse childhood experiences.  

Fortunately, brains and lives are somewhat plastic. Resilience research shows that the appropriate integration of resilience factors — such as asking for help, developing trusting relationships, forming a positive attitude, listening to feelings — can help people improve their lives. Research in to post traumatic growth has identified five broad areas of growth:

· greater appreciation of life, 

· closer relationships with others, 

· increased personal strength, 

· new possibilities in life, and 

· spiritual “development

Which correlate very closely with the dimensions of wellbeing psychology:

· Positive emotions

· Positive engagement

· Positive relationships

· Positive meaning

· Positive accomplishments

· Positive health",Stress

You sacrifice your life, freedom, health, relationship all for some pocket change and a supposed wealth while others are milking from your sacrifice this making you feel like a failure, feeling like that dream is further and further away.

It’s a mindset you need to teach yourself, a mindset where your head is clear and at every obstacle you need to tell yourself no matter what it is that you’ll be fine because LIFE IS TOO SHORT AND CAN CHANGE IN AN INSTANT and then when your health suffers all of these aspirations and dreams do not matter.

I’ve been incidentally diagnosed with cancer - was very lucky as they’ve cut it out fairly quickly, only 3 nights in hospital, painless procedure. I’ve won a lucky dip with life because it was nothing, but seeing people who care about me being so upset was a horrible experience.

I wanted them to be happy and stop worrying because I’ve never thought much of myself then why would they? Because I am nothing, I am not worth anything, low self esteem, never had any aspirations, goals, only liked cars, wasn’t very social, couldn’t really talk to people and sat in my own head alot.

Showing how much those close to me cared for me made me change. When I lay in hospital my head was clear, didn’t worry about work, buying a house, savings or career. Only my family mattered and that’s how I’ve learned this mindset and began adapting my life around it, got rid of as much finance as I could, paid off my phone, sold the BMW bought a cheap Fiat for cash. Financial freedom helped with not worrying about money. Began saving money for a deposit for my new house in the future.

I keep reminding myself to enjoy the little things in life, going for a walk, going to a gym or even buying something fancy to eat here and there on my weekly shop, going restaurant and getting a carbonara or a new phone case. I’ve started eating healthy and looking after my health. I feel happy, proud of myself and I live week by week.

Of course I am aware I am very lucky and not everyone has the same opportunities in life and do not wish to upset anyone by this post. I hope this helps someone to find their path in life.",Stress

"Should I just go ahead and get help? Am I worried about nothing? Is there a way to lose the worst bits of anxiety while keeping the bits that are perhaps somewhat helpful? Or have I got this all wrong and it's not anxiety (but perhaps something else) that makes me productive, etc? Or should I just accept all the awesome things in my life as a totally worthwhile price for feeling worried?",Stress
"Are You an Introvert with Anxiety? Anxiety. That emotion warning us something threatening is just about to happen. Life-saving when we are genuinely threatened, damaging when we become constantly anxious: anxiety is tiring – it is meant to be. We are only meant to be anxious for very short periods. When prolonged, it isn’t just tiring – it is exhausting. Sound familiar? 

Introverts. Those of us who prefer calm situations and environments. We prefer to re-charge on our own. We often enjoy losing ourselves in our own thoughts. We tend to have small, close-knit, social lives it doesn’t mean we’re anti-social!

Not all introverts experience anxiety, and you don’t have to be an introvert to struggle with it. Many introverts deal with anxiety, though, so this is quite common.

Here are the key signs you’re an introvert with anxiety:

· You’re more prepared than most others because you’ve already thought through the worst-case scenarios.

· You have a tendency to over-think things and pay too much attention to your negative self-talk.

· You feel you always have to be doing something – being busy (which is often different from being effective) may be a means of trying to cope with the anxiety.

· You tend to prefer routines to novel situations. While this can be fine for periods, boredom and unexpected issues arising can easily throw you in to a spin.

· You’re often nervous without showing it – many become very effective at masking their emotions as a defence mechanism. 

· You are more likely to perceive situations as being more dangerous than they really are - anxiety primes us for the fight, flight, freeze response making us more likely to over-react to a low-risk situation.

· You have tendencies towards perfectionism. This is often allied to beliefs such as ‘I need to please everyone’, ‘I need everyone to like me to be a worthy person’.

· Nervousness can throw your chatter in to over-drive: while you normally only speak when you have something significant to say (and you’re normally sure of your facts before speaking), nerves can have you chattering away in an attempt to over-compensate.

· You often have trouble sleeping – either getting to sleep a-tall, waking through the night or waking way too early 

Being an introvert with anxiety can be hard. Thankfully there is help at hand. Anxiety in its many guises is one of the most common issues Solution Focused Hypnotherapy therapists helps people with.

"Chronic stress symptoms Over the past few years - like most ppl - I’ve had a rough time with covid lockdown, plus then I was diagnosed with hiatal hernia, then divorce, and now financial pressures of single-handedly running a household.

I was hoping to put this all behind me but last summer new symptoms started to appear:

+ IBS / GERD (hiatal hernia)
+ Cardiac arrythmias (thousands a day)
+ Various skin complaints
+ Alopecia Barbae (beard patches)

I’ve now had 9 months of all these symptoms and I’ve tried individual meds like beta blockers, PPI, tweaking diet, exercise with no luck… the docs say this is all because of going through  a major life disruption and it’s due to underlying stress. The cardio and gerd stuff is so bad I’ve started avoiding stuff but I have CBT planned as a last resort treatment. Concerned the stress is permanently damaging my health.

Anyone deal with anything similar? Go through a major event and suffer chronic stress? Any of these symptoms? Did they resolve after a time?

"Subconscious stress I feel so relieved,free and light after taking a break for about 3-4 days from my daily college routine.I actually went home and enjoyed a lot.But now I realise that I have not felt like this for quite a long time especially since my 2nd proff in med school started.I felt like this after my 1st proff university exams were over and I used to feel like this when I was in my 11th and 12th grade.I guess there is a constant stress or anxiety going on in my subconscious mind that I am not able to feel on a day to day basis as I am very much used to it.Also I have lost taste in so many things.Things do not fascinate me as much as they used to.Even on mobile earlier I could watch from anything to everything and still enjoy.But after med school I do not find anything that much interesting.It may be underlying depression or it may be because I am overworking myself as I am going to library now a days.But also that may not be the case as I started going to library few days back only and I feel this problem has started from a long ago when I got into med school.Still if I think its because of overworking I just cannot cut it loose as in med school they teach at the speed of rocket as due to covid lag our sessions are cut short and still I am not able to cover it all.So doing even less will make me suffer in the long run.
So what to do?

To fail once is one thing, but to fail twice is so much worse. I went to the gym, ran, and practiced throughout the summer, but idk if I am good enough.

"Is it okay that I did nothing over my month off from university? Hi all, thank you for stumbling upon this post. 

The fall semester ended for me in mid-December, and I resume for the spring semester in a week. I'm reflecting on the time I spent while having absolutely no academic, social, or financial responsibility... to say the very least, I'm not very pleased with how I dedicated my time. Much of it was spent sleeping, binge-watching shows, cooking, and staying inside. I did get some important things done, but I can't help but think, ""why couldn't I have done more?"" I had hoped to do some exploring or go out more frequently to enjoy the outdoors. I'm disappointed in myself for not doing so.

At the same time, I'm reminding myself that I needed to not do anything for a whole month after a year and a half of consecutive working. This was my first break in a really long time. I'm just upset about how unwisely I spent it... I don't know.

"I do not know who I am talking to, but sorry for so many posts lately. I have been more active on this sub in the last month than I have been on all of Reddit in years.I think I just need someone to say this to while I figure things out.I have been dealing with suicidal ideation for almost 15 years. I can tell anyone the story of how when I was 12 years old I realized that dying would not bother me, but that is not what this is about. My life since then has always gone impulses, brief periods where I will be okay and productive, followed by increasingly longer and darker cycles where I am down, sad, depressed, unreachable, easily offended, and just generally not the kind of person I ever pictured I would be. And, because I have been dealing with this for so long, I know how to handle these periods, and I have always managed to cling through. I went through a really bad one a couple of years ago, which actually led to my first-ever post on this site, but I made it.But this time feels different. It started a little over two months ago, and drastically got worst a couple weeks back. Something about this does not feel like the norm, where I will think about ending it, imagine what life would be without me, and eventually snap out of it. Something about this feels more serious, more accepting. None of my old methods are working. When I try to make lists of people who will miss me, I said come up with list about how they would react to hearing killed myself, and cannot find anything that is motivating me to stay. When I try to think about everything that I be giving up if I were to end my life, like the show arcs that I will never get to finish, or the paintings I will never get to lay to canvas, none of it is enough to make me want to stay.Nothing is working. It scares me that I have reached this point of acceptance, because this does not feel like a hypothetical wondering of what life would be like if I were not part of it. I am starting to feel an acceptance seep into my bones, and I worry that I am not going to make it to my 28th birthday next year . . .

I am 30 thousand dollars in debt in student loans, the schooling for which has never helped me get a single job. I have never made much more than minimum wage and I have never even put a dent in paying off the loans. What a waste of time and money school was.I have violent thoughts towards myself all the time and often I find myself thinking about violence against faceless entities like ""the government"" or ""the rich"".

I had a crash and burn in my life recently regarding losing my job because of my drug use, as has happened in the past, a really good job too mind you. And its only compounded my already existing problems with depression and daily suicidal ideation. However recently I have landed 2 jobs, one of which was a job I really wanted, so you would think I would be all smiles and optimism. And Id be lying if I said I was not somewhat happier/more optimistic. But that is kind of exactly the point, I feel like I want to end my life right now as I sit here, while being on top. Which let us be honest, my on top right now is still a molehill. I wanted to be on top of a mountain at this point in my life, or at least on my way to it. Instead, in the swamp I wallow, not even possessing the desire to get out, unless you would count suicide as a way out. Its still leagues further away than what I have wanted to accomplish with my life. So much guilt at myself over wasted years and opportunities. Never joined the military. Followed my pipe dreams of being a musician over everything else, and here I am. I take tremendous pleasure in discouraging people from their dreams, as I have had done to myself.

I am so fucking tired of being talked to like I am stupid. I am tired of being stuck in a cycle. I am tired of talking to people I do not want to talk to. I am tired of seeing black people suffer. I am tired of trying my best for not much in return... I am tired of thinking of so many things that make me tired.it is exhausting to be tired. I want to sleep and never be tired again. I thought I was doing better until I was not. that is how it always happens. Sneak attack. Sometimes when I would have a good day, I would think, ""I never would have had this good day if I had killed myself. I hope in the future I do not kill myself."" I do not even remember what the good days were.I do not know what they will be. I do not know if I want to wait around and find out. it is clear to me that, at 23 years old, this is life for me. No matter how much my circumstances change, no matter how much I change, I will always be the same in the same ways that I do not want to be the same. I always thought it would magically get better. Now I am typing this for strangers to read even though it does not matter. Nothing does and everything is bullshit suffering for no reason. we are all selfish viruses aiming to work ourselves to death for a society that will not even pay for our deaths. If I offed myself right now, my family would get a bill for $3000 for transportation of my body alone. Fuck you, America. Fuck everyone else too while I am at it. Hanging on by a thread",Suicidal

"This is something I have done my whole life but I guess I never really put it together. What does it mean exactly to attempt suicide? Like for me, I have written a suicide note, grabbed a knife, put it against my heart and tried to push it in but I could not. I was too scared that I would fail. Similarly, I have done this with pills, hanging, suffocating. Ultimately I just chickened out because I was afraid I would fail and survive it. Then I would cry and hate myself because I felt like a failure that I could not complete it. Anyway, I guess I have always doubted the legitimacy of the things I say to myself or believe.

"26F. Outwardly, I am completely fine. Great job with upward mobility, homeowner, supposed to get married in October to a man who truly loves and supports me and is my childhood best friend, and I love him so much. Inside, I cannot go an hour without thinking about how much I want to die. I suffer from horrible OCD and anxiety. I have habits that I have to do to keep my family members from dying. I used to randomly text people at 3AM to see if they were okay. I am basically just always waiting for something bad to happen, and I was barely sleeping for years. I think I was running on a high from all my anxiety for a long time because I never was depressed. Suddenly, all I want to do is stop being anxious, and I think the only way is to die. I sleep a lot to keep from feeling anxiety. I take naps in the middle of the workday when I used to be a workhorse. I am so, so tired of this. I try to talk to my therapist, and she agrees I am tired but does not think I am really suicidal. If I try to talk to someone in my family (who is kind of falling out and fighting a lot) about it, they say I feel sad sometimes too or you have to let things roll off instead of taking me seriously. My fianc is very concerned and wants me to maybe go inpatient but I do not want to; I went once as a teenager for OCD and it was awful. Clearly nothing will ever help me. Family, therapy, in patient, literally getting married. I have even tried picking up a hobby. I would just feel horrible leaving my fianc alone. that is the only thing that stops me. I used to have my nephews and nieces to think about, but ever since my family started falling out I do not even really have that. I am honestly just rambling at this point and I have no idea why. I am always just rambling about stupid shit which is probably why no one gives a shit when I say I am suicidal. I do not know why doing lifes so hard for me",Suicidal

They all do not know that I have had suicidal thoughts. And I get to this real low point. People never realize the strongest people are the ones that are hurting the most. And if I show sadness they take it lightly because how can this strong woman who offers advice and encouragement be truly hurting. I mentioned to my mom that I am depressed but she still chose to laugh in my face today as I broke down and cried. Which honestly triggered me to want to die. If she only knew. Now I have to pick myself back up and act as if I do not have two full pill bottles in front of me and that I did not just write a suicide note. Fake a smile for everyone that needs me.

By 10 years old I had already told myself that I was ready to die, not that I wanted to,but I was ready.This made me really unrelatable to my peers,I acted like a little old man and never got to experience a normal childhood.By my high-school years everybody thought I was a crackhead because I was always nervous,my clothes were dirty,and I never had good shoes, this led to me accepting that I was a loner,but I am full of social desire.All this made me really cold and unfeeling on the outside,I am really bad at expressing my emotions and anytime someone is fighting or in an argument I revert to the same frozen state of my childhood.Fast forward to now,I am 20 years old and I am the only source of income in my family,my step-dad has been in prison for 3 years on a 15 year bid. My mom has alot of health problems but even so she refuses to work or get disability,her constant drinking worries me.my 16 year old sister lost her mentor when her dad went away,these last few years she has been following my mom's mold,smoking cigarettes,dropping out of school,doing nothing.I work 48 hours a week and when I come home I am 100% occupied by serving others, I have no future, no personality, no ambition, I do not even have my license yet,I am just spinning in circles going through a deep cycle of depression and coping mechanisms.I am fat and short,have an odd shaped body and just generally ugly, I have no redeeming qualities physically,I cannot stand to look at myself in the mirror,or work up the courage to find a GF and be loved,but I get awkward around girls I like and make things weird.I have no purpose.No place on this earth I bought really sharp knives on Amazon, but I do not want to be in pain and reflect on my life as I lie bleeding out,I am waiting to get a gun so I can just do a quick shot to the head and get I over with,no more bad thoughts,no more missing the countless friends I have left behind in the 30+ schools I went to as a kid,no more pain, no more me.

"Hi,I am a 28 year old (she will of a) man from the UK suffering with **severe** depression and most likely an undiagnosed mental illness!I entered such a dark corner of my mind that I tried to take my own life in 2016 and I lost my bottle at the very last moment, now I am what I call, stuck alive.I saw the potential effects that my suicide would have had, everyone told me how upset they were and how distraught they would be if i died.I also remember being distraught, distraught that I had lost my bottle and been saved, distraught that I had woken up in the nightmare I tried to escape from.Ever since that day, I have been stuck alive, too depressed and suicidal to achieve anything, believe anything, want anything, feel anything... Angry at myself and everyone else that I am not dead and do not have the bottle to end it, my step brother died a couple of years ago from an accidental recreational drug overdose and I wished it was me, he was only 18! Why is the world so cruel?This of course highlighted again how devastating a death in the family would be.Each day that passes I slip deeper and deeper into despair, I know this is happening I just cannot stop it, meanwhile my partner of 13 years has become a full-time alcoholic that blames me for every problem she has within herself, I am open-minded, but something tells me if she left me she would quickly discover these kind of problems are rampant within people our age.I am struggling to see the point anymore, pre-pandemic I was doing my dream job, still wanted to kill myself but found myself being too busy to even think about it that much... It was more of an inconvenient intrusive thought at that stage.We scraped our way through doing any work that was available, being mistreated at each company of course, I fear the mental scars that my partner and I now both have on top of our pre-existing issues is just too much to return to normality.She is pressuring me to have a child, people our age tend to feel like we are failing due to seeing previous generations achieve things that are 10x harder for us to facilitate, like providing security and stability for a child!I am receiving professional help, albeit very slowly via the NHS but the poor buggers are overrun as usual and things do not move quickly at all, I am wondering if other people can relate to this permanent lust for what is quite simply a smidge of happiness, I have never felt joy or pride or love and that is all I have ever wanted, I do not need money I just want fulfillment, I just want to wake up in the morning with no immediate desire to die!Let me know if you relate, I seem to feel better hearing other people relate to me otherwise I convince myself I am the problem!

You have all of eternity to not exist. So exist for as long as you can. If you die from other causes besides suicide its the same. Your gone for eternity. Why rush to it? I understand that your life can be horrible and unfair. You are not your family and you are not your situation. there is a chemical imbalance in your head telling you you want to die. I have experienced mental pain and its horrific how your own mind can try to convince you to die. You are your own person regardless of where your from and who you came from. This experience we call life is fascinating and exciting. Just take a moment to feel your body and your breathing. We are the only animal to realize what death is. Its ceasing to exist in this reality. Regardless of what your life entails its amazing that we get to see what the universe has created and experience it for good or bad. do not off yourself.,Suicidal

"I do not know anymore. I just cannot feel happy or anything good, I am always sad and I am constantly telling myself that I *should* be happy. I am doing the things that used to make me happy, but I just feel empty. And then this compared to some of the shit my friends go through, like my friend who is dad started another family whilst still being married to his mom, and he can persist, I, on the other hand, cannot persist after anything negative. And by anything negative it could literally be me listening to some of the music I like (a band I enjoy listening to has some very odd music and if I am feeling some way I can be sent into an episode of sort, ending in me either hurting myself or crying for hours on end, or having to lean on somebody, and that option has been completely scratched off so its only two ig). I have been struggling with suicidal thoughts for quite some time, I just do not see the need to keep pointlessly wade through pain for a mediocre at best experience. I probably hurt myself maybe once or twice a month, usually just like cutting myself on the thigh. I honestly do not think Id be missed when/if I go. My parents want absolutely nothing to do with me, probably because I am a dead beat who cannot get shit done, and when it comes to graded I am like a B student. And then I have like two actual friends, one of which I can barely talk to because her parents strongly dislike me because I would always have to lean on her for support, and she was the only person who could help me while being willing to help me. But apparently I was putting too much pressure on her so I am only allowed to talk to her whenever her parents are around. And my other friend just does not understand what I go through. Anyways I am sorry for whoever read that and idk i do not think I am in direct threat to a suicide (I might like cut myself later though) and I am sorry for wasting your guys time.

"As the title says, I want to die, I really do, but I cannot, I am scared to die, I am scared to move on to whatever is next, I hate myself and know the world would be better if I was gone but I simply cannot, how do I do it without being scared, is there a painless way, this isint a one time thing, or something happened and this is an irrational conclusion, I looked at the facts, and know I am better off not here I do not think living is worth it to be honest but I am too much of a coward to die",Suicidal
I sit here hating every part of me. Wishing when I attempted this shit 12 years ago I would have succeeded. Here I am 12 years have past and all my thoughts during some of my worst times have resurfaced. I am not worth being here especially because I hurt my best friend and the only person who cared for me. I cannot do a damn thing to change it or even make it better. I have been through enough breakups but none like this. I cannot stand the thought of how much I hurt this person. I already hated myself way before this but she has slowly tried to work through those insecurities. They were never fully gone thought. If I lose her then it will also be the first time I would go living without the kids but she right to say they should not be split up. All this is the worst timing because we are suppose to move to the next town over in a month. But if she leaves she will stay here so the kids do not have to transfer. But I am getting off topic. The thought of not being able to have her in my life and not have that one person to turn to sucks. This girl would have been better off if I died 12 years ago so she would have never had the chance to meet me. She gave me the best 8 years of my life and I would rather die with these memories instead of going right back down that dark path I know I am heading for. I wish I could just pull the trigger! I am such a fuck up. I just want to be done with it all.,Suicidal
i cannot anymore. i hate myself and i hate being alive I am going to kill myself in august,Suicidal
"scraped up the last euros i could find on my paypal to atleast get groceries for this week but I am completely fucking broke now. my card got declined for 20 fucking euro purchase today and i do not get money til the 15th this month. the money i get barely covers my living expenses and groceries anyways so cannot borrow money because i will not be able to pay it back anyways, I am unemployed til next month and even then i have not been able to hold a job for more than a year since i dropped out of school.I am only turning 19 this month but have been dealing with this mental health shit since i was fucking twelve.I am so fucking tired. i want to die every day, have 6 psych ward stays and years of therapy behind me but everything keeps falling apart. i do not know what else to try.most nights i end up getting high or drunk just to be able to fall asleep. i cannot keep meds in my apartment because i do not trust myself not to overdose and even if i could, i have such a bad experience with oding and meds in general it is hard for me to take them at all. card got declined getting groceries, I am broke now, i want to fucking die and i do not know what to do",Suicidal
"I cannot get this pain off my chest no matter how hard I try. I cannot kms and I also cannot live like this, its getting out of my hand but there is nothing I can do about it. If only there was a way to never exist in the first place Everything about me is wrong",Suicidal

"Hi,I am a 28 year old (she will of a) man from the UK suffering with **severe** depression and most likely an undiagnosed mental illness!I entered such a dark corner of my mind that I tried to take my own life in 2016 and I lost my bottle at the very last moment, now I am what I call, stuck alive.I saw the potential effects that my suicide would have had, everyone told me how upset they were and how distraught they would be if i died.I also remember being distraught, distraught that I had lost my bottle and been saved, distraught that I had woken up in the nightmare I tried to escape from.Ever since that day, I have been stuck alive, too depressed and suicidal to achieve anything, believe anything, want anything, feel anything... Angry at myself and everyone else that I am not dead and do not have the bottle to end it, my step brother died a couple of years ago from an accidental recreational drug overdose and I wished it was me, he was only 18! Why is the world so cruel?This of course highlighted again how devastating a death in the family would be.Each day that passes I slip deeper and deeper into despair, I know this is happening I just cannot stop it, meanwhile my partner of 13 years has become a full-time alcoholic that blames me for every problem she has within herself, I am open-minded, but something tells me if she left me she would quickly discover these kind of problems are rampant within people our age.I am struggling to see the point anymore, pre-pandemic I was doing my dream job, still wanted to kill myself but found myself being too busy to even think about it that much... It was more of an inconvenient intrusive thought at that stage.We scraped our way through doing any work that was available, being mistreated at each company of course, I fear the mental scars that my partner and I now both have on top of our pre-existing issues is just too much to return to normality.She is pressuring me to have a child, people our age tend to feel like we are failing due to seeing previous generations achieve things that are 10x harder for us to facilitate, like providing security and stability for a child!I am receiving professional help, albeit very slowly via the NHS but the poor buggers are overrun as usual and things do not move quickly at all, I am wondering if other people can relate to this permanent lust for what is quite simply a smidge of happiness, I have never felt joy or pride or love and that is all I have ever wanted, I do not need money I just want fulfillment, I just want to wake up in the morning with no immediate desire to die!Let me know if you relate, I seem to feel better hearing other people relate to me otherwise I convince myself I am the problem! Maybe I am??? Am I Dead?",Suicidal
@itsmeAJyo You think I like the feeling of walking past a homeless person knowing I'm gonna give them money I wishâ¦ https://t.co/9ybTrA6RRK,Suicidal
"Yesterday a guy I have been talking to for a few weeks blocked me out of the blue. I am really hurt. I do not know what is wrong with me, I mess it up every time I try to start a relationship. No one wants me, I am so sick of it. This guy seemed so wonderful, he was so sweet and affectionate, it seemed too good to be true. I cared about him so much. Why would he do that to me? I am so angry. I would never do that to someone, hes caused me so much pain. I have been so lonely and sad for so long, I was so excited to have hope at being happy for once. Other people do not understand because they do not know how fucking horrible I feel all the time and how much I really need this.I know its so pathetic but I have been trying to contact him on different accounts on different social media but he keeps blocking me. He really cannot just tell me why he unadded me? This is the angriest I have felt in so long. I am fucking alone, people do not enjoy being around me, most people do not understand, I might as well just end it I am so fucking lonely",Suicidal
"I have been feeling so shitty for over a year now, I get suicidal thoughts everyday yet I am such a pussy. I have been struggling a lot with my gender and sexuality. I fucking hate school and I am starting college soon and I just know I cannot handle it. My parents are always on my back, I got really drunk one night and came out to my mum as bigender, I do not really know if I am but at the time it felt right, she freaked out and the next day both my parents were in my room screaming at me. My parents are divorced and I explicitly told my mum not to tell my dad. We do not get on and never have.They then got me tested for autism as apparently gender identity issues and autism are linked, regardless if they are got diagnosed but apparently I am really high functioning so it should not affect me much in life, they then blamed it all on that and we never spoke about it again. I am also pansexual but that last coming out ordeal has taught me my parents are not trustworthy or very supportive so fuck coming out again. I have been self harming for about 2 months now, I do not know wot it is about it but its the only time I feel anything. I have also been wanting to try girls clothes, I was born a guy and I have got no idea about my gender anymore but I know that I do like girls clothes however I have no way to get any, and my parents would definitely kick me out if I started wearing them. My friends are pretty supportive but i know they just do not get me, I do not blame them I do not either, it makes me feel so alone. The one positive as of late tho happened the other day when I was coming home from being out with my friends, I decided to run home instead of getting the bus, it was pitch black and I was just blasting my music and it actually felt pretty good. Anyway this was more of a rant I just really do not know wot tf to do I do not even know what to do anymore",Suicidal
"as a borderline, I have never had a single decent relationship with anybody. my parents are abusive, all my previous friends left me, and my FP is slowly leaving me. all i can think of is just jumping out of my window. it is already open, i feel like I am just looking down at my grave. people always like to tell you you are not alone, that there is someone that loves you out there, and people even say it to prevent you from suicide. but that is not true.",Suicidal
I am broke but have found money to drink like usual. I do not have a drinking problem I have an escaping from my feelings problem. Sometimes its food or tv or games or my phone. But. The thing is this week is so important. I have several interviews for high paying jobs. I will not be broke anymore. But instead of celebrating I still want to die. I do not want to do this all by myself anymore. I am all alone financially supporting myself my bf my animals. I love them all and I do not want to leave. But they deserve better. I do not know. I am broke lol,Suicidal
"I have made a list of the pros and cons of me ending my life and the cons heavily outweigh the pros. However, I am having an extremely difficult time today. I have been crying all day and I just feel so tired of everything. I know that I cannot give up now but the idea is so tempting. I am contemplating calling the suicide hotline but I am not even sure what I would say. I have struggled with mental health my entire life. But honestly I do not get these suicidal thoughts and temptations that much. So when I do it feels like a very good idea. Which makes me very worried. I am not sure what I am asking for. I guess to everyone reading this, this stuff is so hard. I hope we all end up okay. I do not know what else to say. I hope we all find a reason to not do it. I do not know what I should do anymore",Suicidal
"I do not understand how in this day in age people still need to beg for help.I suffer with serious depression and anxiety as well as several other physical illnesses, I have reached out to my local services for the last 2 years but help is not there. It has now reached the point where I have 3 suicide attempts in the last month and guess what still nothing. Who now do I turn to ? I just find it very sad that our NHS is praised on how good a job they are doing when in really this is what is happening across the whole NHS board. Suicide rates are hitting all time highs and lockdown has has a major impact on these figures I understand this but how can they praise the NHS for saving so many lives in one way but ignore the lives they are losing in others ? Mental health a joke",Suicidal
"I wanted to end myself so many times I cannot even count. Couple times i wanted do it for real. I even made advanced preparation once. I am still here and I hate the fact I am still here. Wish i was dead but I am to much of a coward to end myself. Thought that maybe if I stop posting focus on some other things I can be better with time. That I can distract myself. Well I am only getting worse. I think about suicide every single day, every single hour. Only emotions I feel are anger and sadness. Sometimes i cannot even control myself, things I do or say. I can hate everything and everybody only to feel extreme saddness after couple minutes. Only constant is that I feel like a piece of shit all the time. Drinking helps a little but only for short period of time. The more drunk I am the more depressed i become. I miss times when i was happy and wanted to party after drinking. I do not want to talk about my reasons. They are pathetic and if somebody is curious my post history is open. I cannot keep on living like this. I want to be dead. that is the only thing i want. I almost got hit by a car this week and wish it was almost. Wish i was not coward and ended this already. There is no point in staying alive. Being alive only makes me suffer. I hate the world we live in and the world hates me. This world wants me to kill myself and I am not strong enough to keep on fighting forever. I am here again. Wish I was not(this way or another)",Suicidal
There is always downs in my life but never ups I just want to end it Wtf changes in my life if I do not suicide ?,Suicidal

"i used to be scared that my mom would be sad and kill herself too but i honestly do not care anymore. I am allowed to be selfish for once in my life. fuck everything and everyone, I am outta here I am going to kill myself tonight",Suicidal
"I have been having suicidal thoughts lately because I have been thinking about the terrible and disgusting things people do and will do. It makes me think, surely the afterlife or even if there is not one could not be this bad. I want to be gone forever",Suicidal
"I am 22. i have a whole life ahead. every night before i sleep, i pray, please end my suffering. its funny how I am an atheist but I am still praying to any god out there who will listen to my prayers. I am so tired. i should have killed myself when i was 12. i just want to die",Suicidal
"My life has been pretty shit since i moved to my current city 8 years ago. Mental health has been on the rock bottom forever and i think i will not make it. I am starting to think i am shizophrenic , sometimes i cannot tell if the demons i see are my imagination, the voices i hear, and the faces of the dead i see when i close my eyes. help Should i ?",Suicidal
its too painful for me.. I am going to kill myself,Suicidal
"no one actually gives a shit about me. i just because problems. the only reason I am still here, my girlfriend, stopped talking to me over the summer, we where so close i loved her but i do not think she gives a shit about me any more, i just want her to drop me so i can cry and move on. i want it to be over. my brain will not shut the fuck up. i cannot stop hitting my self in the side of the skull just to feel the pain that is inside my head. i need to end it",Suicidal
"Are we in Hell? In order to survive in this world we must murder and devour another life form (plant, animal, insect). We have forgotten this because now other people do that for us but we cannot survive unless we do that. So if god is so much loving as he claims to be why would he create such an horrible place where we all have to kill each other to survive? Plus why is life so cruel for so many of us? This system only favor a few at the top and the rest are thrash basically. And look who are the richest people alive. All of them are assholes who built their fortune by exploiting dirt cheap labor in under developed countries. It feels like the only way to come on top of the food chain is to be the ultimate asshole. And the last thing, if we somehow disagree with this system and do not want to be part of it, the only way out seems to be suicide, which is a very painful and traumatic way to end it. So most of us hate this place but we stay alive because suicide is very painful and traumatic. And really who knows if the pain stops after death? Because that is another thing... we do not even know why we are here and what is next. Are we in Hell?",Suicidal
So read my recent posts please and tell me how I survive in prison UK after they take me I am 18 do not have no understanding of the law I have autism what am I eligible for solicitor wise what is it like I have a lot of people who want me dead because of something that happened and I had to protect my family by calling the police I am not scared of dying just scared of the experience as I have pissed off a lot of undercover police officers by confronting them about what they have been doing so when I get took away I am 1000% going to be abused by them I have my word and I do not care about any evidence which has been made to incriminate me I would give a backstory but when I get arrested they will take my phone and probably read this just know I GOT SOMEBODY ARRESTED AND HE SET ME UP WITH A GIRL WHO WAS UNDERAGE I BELIEVED SHE WAS 17 her stepdads dad is a former police officer too this was all a setup from the day I met her multiple people I have had good relationships with in the past are making false allegations to get me locked up because of what that guy did This probably seems crazy to everybody nobody has to believe me I would not too if multiple people were saying the same thing but trust me I have been a target since I was 13 and people have successfully ruined my life I have no evidence to back anything up as I cut people off deleted social media accounts etc but now idk what to do just know this was a HUGE SETUP I tried being a people pleaser for years and now I am going to jail for a long time and will probably be ruined in the media what do I do help me Prison because of corrupt police or suicide ?

Just walking next to a Lake with people kayaking.I would love to do it and I remember the time my 7 year older friend (I was 14 though) and I went kayaking and it was loads of fun. But since then I have not found and Single Person who wants to these kinds of things with me.Makes me feel sad to watch. I walk around and everything just reminds me of not being able to do any of the activities because I have no one I feel comfortable with and who feels comfortable with me,Suicidal
